First: download your file

Then can use for example:

shasum -a 512  hadoop-3.2.2.tar.gz

it will provide a string.

You will have to compare this string to the checksum file available near the downloaded file provided by the owner:
In the case of hadoop, Apache provides a .512 file. Therefore we will just downloadn and then open this file with cat:

cat hadoop-3.2.2.tar.gz.sha512

You can also open it with nano but it will provide a string without wrapping the text.



Or:

sha256sum (name of file. drag your file here. it will appear the address)

if the checksum file is an .mds file then you should use:

shasum -a 256 hadopp-3.2.2.tar.gz

and then compare the 2 codes
