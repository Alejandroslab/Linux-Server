Apache on Ubuntu has one server block enabled by default that is configured to serve documents from the /var/www/html directory. 
While this works well for a single site, it can become unwieldy if you are hosting multiple sites. 

Instead of modifying /var/www/html, 

create a directory structure within /var/www for a your_domain site, 

leaving /var/www/html in place as the default directory to be served if a client request doesnâ€™t match any other sites.



create the directory for your domain:
sudo mkdir /var/www/your_domain

then set permissions:

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/your_domain


create a file:
vim /var/www/your_domain/index.html

and type:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to Your_domain!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success!  The your_domain virtual host is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>



Now create a new directive:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.conf

and type in:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerName your_domain
    ServerAlias www.your_domain
    DocumentRoot /var/www/your_domain
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>


change just the 'your_domain' with your domain (at the fourth line leave 'www.' at the beginning

save and exit

now enable this directive with:

sudo a2ensite your_domain.conf

and disale the old ones with:

sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf


now test for config errros:

sudo apache2ctl configtest

You should see:
Output
Syntax OK

restart the service to make changes 
sudo systemctl restart apache2

now if you go to 'http://your_domain' you will get the message 

'Success!  The your_domain virtual host is working!'

'your_domain' in this case is the hostname of your server 
this may differ from the 'your_domain' that you set up inside apache files ! (I have made a test placing 'your_domain' like 'test' in any config file)
