As we have installed Jupyter on a server with no GUI we need to connect from another machine

To do this we need to connect with the SSH Tunneling as it seems to be the only way to connect to Jupyter

From our local machine we will connect therfore with ssh with this command:


ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 server_user@the_ubuntu_server_hostname


The port is usually 8888 but it can change. Anyways you can try on your server just running jupyter with the command 'jupyter notebook'

anyways the ssh command opens an SSH connection;
-L specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side (server).

This means that whatever is running on the second port number (e.g. 8888) on the server will appear on the first port number (e.g. 8888) on your local computer (localhost)

NOTE: the localhost cannot be changed otherwise you will not be able to connect!!
This is the way on how Jupyter is supposed to be connected

Running the command will ask you the server username password as in any other ssh connection and then
you are connected to the server forwarding the 8888 server port to the 8888 local port of your client(in this case the macos machine)


Optionally change port 8888 to one of your choosing to avoid using a port already in use by another process.
