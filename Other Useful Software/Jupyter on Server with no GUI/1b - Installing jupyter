Now after having activated the virtual environment we install Jupyter:

pip install jupyter

When finished just move to your local machine from which you want to connect.
Leave the server
If you are connected via ssh simpy close the connection

(If you run now you will just see the address with a token (a long string of characters) but if you have a
server with no gui you will not be able to access it)
