After having connected successfully move to the folder in which you have installed the virtual environment
activate the virtual environment and run jupyter notebook!

with these 3 commands:

cd ~/my_project_dir

source my_project_env/bin/activate

jupyter notebook


_____
Now the notebook will run. From now on we will call it the 'jupyter server'

A log of the activities of the Jupyter Notebook will be printed to the terminal.
And a url will be printed


Copy the URL that will be printed.
This url will have a token (a long string of characters) that will change anytime you close and open the jupyter server

Paste it in a browser on your local machine and voila!

REMEMBER!! Keep the server connection active otherwise you will not be able to work on your notebooks

To close the connection simply close the process with ctrl+c

done!


Inside jupyter click on New>Python3
and a new notebook will open!
