first establish ssh Connection
#First type
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail@email.com"

When it asks for 'file in which to save the key' just press enter

Then it asks for a passphrase (if you want to create one). You can skip it just pressing enter again (it will be asked twice)

#Second type:


eval $(ssh-agent -s)

it will ask for the passphrase previously set and it will print something like:

'Agent pid 0029'

#Third,:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

again it will ask for the passphrase previously set. then will print

'Identity added : ~/.ssh/id_rsa/ etc....'

#Finally you could go to your working (Home) folder enter in the folder .ssh (that is hidden)
and open the file

id_rsa.pub

Copy the code inside the file.

Go to github->settings> SSH and GPG Keys-> click on New SSH Key-> put a title and paste the

code of the id_rsa.pub

click on add and you are done!

you should do this procedure just once!

now you can clone your repos

Git clone ...put code from website

now test it adding a new file

touch file.txt

git add

git status

git commit

now it will ask for credentials (just a name and an email)

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git commit

now git push
to push it to the server

done! git is correctly configured with linux
