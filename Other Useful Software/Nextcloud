Nextcloud is the best solution to manage files even in a collaboration!
it is very similar to Dropbox but you will be in full control of
your own data

I think that this could be the best platform-based solution
(as it is also open source) in order to manage folders and share
data with external people, but inside your server.

(the other way is to use proprietary software like in qnap that has
qsync, myqnapcloud and so on..
i prefer to use open source stuff)

first we have to run a VM in Ubuntu!

_________________________________-
It is better to install nextcloud in a Linux (Ubuntu, Debian) server
rather than on a Container


Because it is easier for troubleshooting and then because
docker lacks some basic function like 'crontab' and much others..

therefore just go safe with VM

installing Nextcloud in Ubuntu server is far far easier than installing on Raspbian

first! as usual first update and upgrade your server!

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

(silently as always with opton -y)

now install nextcloud just with one line!
look at raspbian how many things you have to do.. Debian is similar.
(you have to install apache, php, mysql etc..)
The fact is that in Ubuntu comes preinstalled a lot of stuff while in Debian
everything is up to you.
Anyways just launch:



sudo snap install nextcloud



we have almost finished. Now just launch this final command to
setup the user and the password that will allow you to connect to
nextcloud:



sudo nextcloud.manual-install myuser mypassword



where 'myuser' and 'mypassword' are the username and the mypassword
that will allow you to login to the nextcloud

DONE!

now if you want to access you can type in your browser
the ip address or the hostname of the server linked

192.168.1.20

or

myubuntuserver.local

(REMEMBER that when you type myubuntuserver.local the browser
but also nextcloud itself will attempt to connect via 'https'
you have to change it to 'http' until at least you get ssl certificates)
(ssl certifcates are free from let's encrypt)

anyways it will come up: 'Access through untrusted domain'

This because Nextcloud will not allow to login if you have not indicate
the domains.

to do that just launch:

sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=192.168.1.*
sudo nexcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 2 --value=myubuntuserver.local

(remember to leave the numbers 1,2 as they indicate the order to be listed in
the config file. if you want to authorize another domain just insert '3' and so on)

I listed even 'myubuntuserver.local' as it is always more safe to hide the real
ip (even if internal)


DONE!
you have now have nextcloud inside your LAN Network
in order to have external access is always suggested to setup a VPN to the LAN
network.
(It is preferable to setup the vpn not inside the server/NAS
but on a separated and dedicated appliance like a raspberrypi..)


you will have otherwise to rely on external service like duckdns

______________________
data will be stored here:

/var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/myuser/files


the good thing about Nextcloud is that it will use all the size of the Disk
As in Ubuntu Server virtualized, the image will expand as necessary, this means
also that nextcloud folders will expand as much as they need!
