There are 2 Jupyter currently:

-Jupyter Notebook
-Jupyter Lab

The Notebook is the basic version that will allow you to have a simple notebook for python in which you
will have markdown and you will be able to Code

jupyter lab is an extension and as it is an improvement it can be installed as a second layer AFTER installing the notebook

We will install jupyter on a server/instance locally (not on a live server. Therefore you will need vpn if you want to access it). The server has Ubuntu Server as OS

Then we will have access from another machine (from a macos machine that will work as a client of the server)


Jupyter will be also installed on a virtual environment inside the server
