first update

sudo apt-get update -y

Then install pip and python3

sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev


To manage the virtual environment (aside of conda) we install the virtuaenv package that will allow
to manage virtual environments as Conda does.

SO install virtuaenv:

sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv

The -H flag ensures that the security policy sets the home environment variable to the home directory of the target user.

After installing let's create a folder in which place the virtual environment and move into it

mkdir ~/my_project_dir
cd ~/my_project_dir

Now let's create the virtual environment inside this folder

virtualenv my_project_env

Inside, it will install a local version of Python and a local version of pip. We can use this to install and configure an isolated Python environment for Jupyter.

As for Conda we need to activate this virtual environment to isolate it correctly
Therefore we run:

source my_project_env/bin/activate

The prompt will change starting with "(my_project_env).."
