it could happens sometimes that anaconda is deleted from PATH

you have to readd it manually

sudo nano /.bashrc

insert This
export PATH=/home/as/anaconda3/bin

now refresh anaconda with init:

first go to the installation folder


cd anaconda3/bin
./conda init bash

now reload the configuration file:

 source ~/.bashrc
