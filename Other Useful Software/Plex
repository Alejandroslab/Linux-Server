The main idea was to install plex on raspberry and then connect the contents of a wdmycloud
(see how to mount a network folder)

Update first always

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

install this package that allows to retrieve packages over https

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Add the Plex repositories to the apt package managers key list:

curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

Add the official plex repository to the sources list:

echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list


sudo apt-get update

now install!

sudo apt-get install plexmediaserver

after installation plex will run automatically you can control the status with the usual:

sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver


Now, the Plex Media Server package will utilize a user named plex.
To reduce the chances of dealing with permission issues, we could change the serverâ€™s default file:

sudo nano /etc/default/plexmediaserver

export PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_USER=pi

sudo systemctl restart plexmediaserver



Now you can run it via web browser:

MyIPorHostname:32400/web/

in the case of a Rasperrypi

raspberrypi:32400/web/

now signup for a plex account (yes you have to register..)

then you can choose a name for the media server and finally choose the folder

when choosing a folder you will choose the network folder that point to wdmycloud
remmeber that the folder should be always mounted (it should be put a line on fstab)

this means that if you reboot your system it will unmount the link of the folder



remember!
to unistall
sudo apt-get purge plexmediaserver

you can also delete:
sudo userdel plex
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/plexmediaserver

/var/lib/plexmediaserver is the folder for plex to manage data


____________
you can install plex also on QTS donwloading the specific app
in case you just want to use data from another network folder
you can use the app 'Hybrid Mount' in order to mount
the specific folder.

During the plex installation (way more straightforward)
it will ask to choose the Library folder to scan
go to 'share' folder of the NAS and inside that
you will find your network folder mounted by Hybrid Mount app
(in this case the hybrid mount will create just a link
to the real path that is on another folder. it is a good
workaround to use plex inside qts)

then you are done!

remember! if you not manage to load all the metadata
(covers, name of actors, etc) you have first go to settings
(the wrench icon on the top right side of Plex bar)
then select you library (if you have more than one)
in setting you will find 'Agents'
now for every category (film, programme, artist etc)
open it and go to 'The Movie Database'
check 'The Movie Database' option and put it at the top
of the list

you can leave checked also 'Local Media Assets' option
but be sure to leave it as second option.

now click on Home button

select your library on the left column.
you wil find three dots
click on 'Manage Library' and then 'Refresh All Metadata'

wait and you are done.

REMEMBER! 'Analyse library' and 'Refresh All Metadata'
will not perform the same operations.

Analyse library will check library consistency and edits
like if a movie has been removed etc...
On the contrary 'Refresh all Metadata' option will
allow to redownload (or download if you have not already any metadata)
the metadata for every file you have in your library.
