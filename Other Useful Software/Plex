The main idea was to install plex on raspberry and then connect the contents of a wdmycloud
(see how to mount a network folder)

Update first always

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

install this package that allows to retrieve packages over https

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Add the Plex repositories to the apt package managers key list:

curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

Add the official plex repository to the sources list:

echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list


sudo apt-get update

now install!

sudo apt-get install plexmediaserver

after installation plex will run automatically you can control the status with the usual:

sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver


Now, the Plex Media Server package will utilize a user named plex.
To reduce the chances of dealing with permission issues, we could change the serverâ€™s default file:

sudo nano /etc/default/plexmediaserver

export PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_USER=pi

sudo systemctl restart plexmediaserver



Now you can run it via web browser:

MyIPorHostname:32400/web/

in the case of a Rasperrypi

raspberrypi:32400/web/

now signup for a plex account (yes you have to register..)

then you can choose a name for the media server and finally choose the folder

when choosing a folder you will choose the network folder that point to wdmycloud
remmeber that the folder should be always mounted (it should be put a line on fstab)

this means that if you reboot your system it will unmount the link of the folder



remember!
to unistall
sudo apt-get purge plexmediaserver

you can also delete:
sudo userdel plex
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/plexmediaserver

/var/lib/plexmediaserver is the folder for plex to manage data
