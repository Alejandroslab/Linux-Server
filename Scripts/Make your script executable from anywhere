Create a folder with all your scripts

you can also set an alias to make it easier to remember and type 

    Make the scripts executable: chmod +x $HOME/scripts/*
    This needs to be done only once.

    Add the directory containing the scripts to the PATH variable: export PATH=$HOME/scrips/:$PATH
    (Verify the result with echo $PATH.)

    The export command needs to be run in every shell session.

    For convenience, you want to add that command to the $HOME/.profile file so it is run automatically for you at log-in time.
