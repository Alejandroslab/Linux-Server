sudo adduser newuser2

to remove a user

sudo userdel newuser2

It works also in Debian. Rememeber that Debian will not ad your user in the sudo
group. You will have to do that changing to root and giving privilege to your
user:

su root

sudo adduser myuser sudo

and then

su myuser

Users will be located inside home folder
