When you have another user that has not admin privileges (sudo) then you can check how many
he will try to do that.

It will appear to him the message: "The user is not in the sudoers file. The incident will be reported."

The incident is reporte here:

/var/log/auth.log

you can see it with cat:

cat /var/log/auth.log

As this file is really long you may want to see only the last 20 lines:

tail -20 /var/log/auth.log
