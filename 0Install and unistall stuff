Update repositories

sudo apt-get update



list all the installed packages

apt list --installed



update packages

sudo apt-get upgrade



To install:

sudo apt-get install -y

-y stands for silent install. it will install without asking questions.


keep in mind that 'apt' and 'apt-get' are pretty much interchangeable where
'apt-get' is the older command.



to list available updates without install them:

apt list --upgradable

or with the old command:

sudo apt-get -u upgrade --assume-no

(sudo is necessary as it will check permissions (at least this happen in Debian))
