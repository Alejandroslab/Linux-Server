sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba

Now that Samba is installed, we need to create a directory for it to share:

mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/


The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

sudo vim  /etc/samba/smb.conf


At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:

[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes


done!


Now:

sudo service smbd restart
sudo ufw allow samba

Finally! Since Samba doesn’t use the system account password, we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:

(if you skip this step it will be assumed that you are a Guest user and you will enter without password)

sudo smbpasswd -a username

USERNAME USED MUST BELONG TO A SYSTEM ACCOUNT, ELSE IT WON’T SAVE.
This means if the user does not exist you must first create a system user and then set the samba password with the upper command (that can be the same password of the login)


To keep it simple you could choose
a username equal to the login user in linux.

Then it will ask for a password and to confirm it.

now you can connect !







Now create a shared folder (or you can just use a prexisting folder)

mkdir nomecartelladacondividere

Open the configuration file for Samba:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Just type these commands at the end of the document:

[nomecartelladacondividere]
path = /home/utentelinux/nomecartelladacondividere
available = yes
valid users = utentesamba
Read only = no
Browsable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes

Between the squared brackets you have to type the name of the shared folder previously created.

Tip: The name that you put between squared brackets is just a title.
This is the name that the Guest will see (as for example in windows).
This means that this name could differ from the real folder name that anyways is
specified in the path field

Save and close (with classic nano commands)





Now restart Samba

sudo service smbd restart



DONE!



Now go to Windows and create a new shortcut:

\\IP-ADDRESS\nomecartelladacondividere

You can swap ip address with hostname if you desire (without the suffix '.local'). Click next then finish.

Now when you will try to open it will request username and password (the ones created in the configuration file).


to check online users:

sudo smbstatus



REMEMBER! that the samba password could be different from the user account password!
Keep in mind when you set samba password!(sometimes you can just typing the wrong password and it will not connect to your folder)
