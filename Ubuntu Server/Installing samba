sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba

Now that Samba is installed, we need to create a directory for it to share:

mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/


The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf


At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:

[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes


done!
    Now:
sudo service smbd restart
sudo ufw allow samba

Since Samba doesn’t use the system account password, we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:
(if you skip this step it will be assumed that you are a Guest user and you will enter without password)

sudo smbpasswd -a username

Username used must belong to a system account, else it won’t save.

now you can connect !
