sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba

Now that Samba is installed, we need to create a directory for it to share:

mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/


The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

sudo vim  /etc/samba/smb.conf


At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:

[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes


done!


Now:

sudo service smbd restart
sudo ufw allow samba

Finally! Since Samba doesn’t use the system account password, we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:

(if you skip this step it will be assumed that you are a Guest user and you will enter without password)

sudo smbpasswd -a username

USERNAME USED MUST BELONG TO A SYSTEM ACCOUNT, ELSE IT WON’T SAVE.
This means if the user does not exist you must first create a system user and then set the samba password with the upper command (that can be the same password of the login)

now you can connect !
