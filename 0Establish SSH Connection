Firs install

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

then edit with nano or other the config file

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Insert these lines:
____________________
Port 22
MaxAuthTries

SendEnv LANG LC_*
HashKnownHost yes
GSSAPAuthentication yes
_________________________

(without the line at the beginning and at the end)

If the lines are already there but start with # you should just delete the # symbol.

Save and close nano.

To check the status

sudo service ssh status

If the service is not running:

 sudo service ssh start

and you can stop with:

 sudo service ssh stop

Then you are done.

In Windows you have to download Putty and connect to the server with hostname or IP address
hostname, hostname -I

(To copy lines in putty just highlight them. To paste lines in Putty just click right in the terminal windows).

At the first starting of Putty, a security alert will appear indicating then
'key fingerprint' in md5 format. Keep note of this fingerprint.

Click 'No' the first time then login in the server (Putty will ask to save in the cache)

type:

ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub

now compare the two fingerprint. if they are the same you can safely save the Connection
to the Putty's cache)

In Mac and Linux (whichever distro) just open Terminal, check if openssh is installed typing

ssh

then just:

ssh username@IPserverOrHostname

it will then ask for your password and then you will connect to the server.
