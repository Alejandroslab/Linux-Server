You can also create a file in which insert your command and then run from the file in this WAY
let's suppose that the command is 'pwd'

therefore
create

vi mycommandfile


insert inside

pwd

save and exit


now you can run the file using '$' symbol and cat that will retrieve the text from a file.

it can open text files basically without using an Editor

cat mycommandfile

you will see

pwd

as this is what was written inside

now:

$(cat mycommandfile)

will run the text inside the file. therefore in this case will run 'pwd'
