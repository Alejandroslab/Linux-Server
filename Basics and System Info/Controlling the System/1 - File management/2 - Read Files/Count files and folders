first option (THE ONE THAT YOU WILL USE MOST OF THE TIMES)

ls | wc -l

it will pipe ls inside wc commands that counts characters, bytes or newlines counts


if you use:
ls -l | wc -l

it will be counted another line (the first that appears only launching ls -l
that is 'total...' that is the total disk allocation)

the other option is to install 'tree' package (if you have not already)

then launch

tree

at the end of the command it will be displayed the number of folders!
