The UNIX philosophy is to have small tools. One tool is doing exactly one thing, but this especially well.

The tar tool is just combining several files into a single file without any compression.

The gzip tool is just compressing a single file.

If you want to have both, you just combine both tools resulting in a .tar.gz file.

The zip tool is a completely different thing. It takes a bunch of files and combines them into a single compressed file. With totally different algorithms.




to create a new archive:


tar -cvf myarchive.tar *


myarchive.tar is the name of the tar file and '*' indicate to include in the archive all the files present in the current directory

-cvf will create verbosely a new tar file




to list the content of a tar file:

tar -tf myarchive.tar


to create a compressed file:

tar -cjf myarchive.tar.bz2 *

there is no need to add the bz2 extension but is useful when you need to recognize the type of file

(anyways you can check the file type with 'file myarchive')





another well known compressed file type is xz

tar -cJf myarchive.tar.xz *
