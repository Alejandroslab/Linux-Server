If I want to remove all the content just:

rm Pictures/*

in this case everyhting INSIDE the folder pictures will be deleted

if there are subdirectories you can use the recursive option


rm -r Pictures/*

you can also move to the folder and then remove all the content simply tiping;

cd myfolder

then:

rm !()

you can also use:
rm -v !()


you will get the verbose mode

the '!' indicates an exception:

if you want to remove all files except one:

rm -v !("myfile.txt")
