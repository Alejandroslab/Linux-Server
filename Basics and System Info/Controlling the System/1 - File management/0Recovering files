BECAREFUL when you delete with
rm -r
as recovering files in linux is not easy


you have to use testdisk to recover files
(but no idea if it can work with folders)

sudo apt install testdisk

now if your disk is formatted as fat32
or ntfs you can use:


testdisk

if it does not work just run:

sudo testdisk /dev/vda1

where 'vda1' is the name of the disk
in which linux is installed
(it could also have other name)


you have use PhotoRec (that also
comes with the testdisk package installation) if your
disk is formatted as ext2, ext4
