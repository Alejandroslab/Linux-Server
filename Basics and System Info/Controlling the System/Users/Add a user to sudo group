To add a user to the sudo group:

sudo adduser newuser2 sudo

It works also in Debian. Rememeber that Debian will not ad your user in the sudo
group. You will have to do that changing to root and giving privilege to your
user:

su root

sudo adduser myuser sudo

and then

su myuser

Users will be located inside home folder

on Ubuntu root user exists and it does not have a password as it is blocked by the system
root has no password

Debian is different. It allows to log as root unlike Ubuntu server system.
