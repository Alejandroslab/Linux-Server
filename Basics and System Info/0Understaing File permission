Read is equivalent to ‘4’. (in decimal form)
Write is equivalent to ‘2’.
Execute is equivalent to ‘1.’

When we want to set permissions, we just add a number. For example, to set the permissions to “read and write,” we use “6” (4 + 2) for the permission. For read, write and execute, we’ll use “7” (4 + 2 + 1) for the permission.


0 – no permission
1 – execute
2 – write
3 – write and execute
4 – read
5 – read and execute
6 – read and write
7 – read, write, and execute

What does this mean for ‘”777?”
The first digit is assigned to the Owner,
the second digit is assigned to the Group
and the third digit is assigned to the Others.

If a file has the  “777” permission, then everyone can read, write and execute the file.
