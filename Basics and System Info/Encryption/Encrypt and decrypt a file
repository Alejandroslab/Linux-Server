to encrypt the file 'test' that will become the file 'test.enc':

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc    -in    test  -out    test.enc

This command will ask you a password to encrypt your file 'test'

to decrypt the file

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in test.enc > test.txt

after inputting the password this command will print the output to a new file called 'test.txt' in order to not overwrite the original one
