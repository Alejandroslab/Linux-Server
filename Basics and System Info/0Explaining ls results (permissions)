when you run

ls -l

you will see something like:

drwxr-xr-x 2 me   me   4096 Apr  5 17:18  Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 3 me   me   4096 Apr 29 11:10  Documents
....

the first column indicates if the file is a directory (it will start
with 'd') or not (it will start with a dash '-') for a file or with an 'l' for a symbolic link
it will also specify the file permissions

then you will have 9 characters that basically are a sequence of

rwx = read, write, execute

it is repeated threee times because it specifies permission for
the owner, the group and the world (others).

the first 3 characters are for the owner, the second 3 are for
the group and the last 3 are for others

this means that

in the example:

drwxr-xr-x

means that is a directory in which the OWNER has full permission (rwx)
the GROUP has only 'r-x' and OTHERS or the WORLD has only 'r-x' permission

there is no separation between them. the dash '-' indicates the permission not available
in this case for GROUP it will not be possible to write as the position of the 'w' is covered by a dash '-'


to change permissions you can change it with 'chmod'
where inly the owner or the superuser can change it.


drwxr-xr-x

the second column indicate the number of hard links

the third column indicates the username of the directory or file's owner

the fourth column indicates the group of the directory or file's owner

the fifth column indicates the size in bytes!

then you finally have date and time for the sixth and the seventh column
and finally the name of the file or directory!
