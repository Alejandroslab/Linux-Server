The PATH is the list of paths that the system will inspect to run applications.

To check this list of files:

echo $PATH


REMEMEBER! If you have messed up with your PATH and your new folders added to it are not persistent
you may want to check the other files like: .profile or .bash_profile
You will see there other programs that maybe you have previously added.
_________


sudo nano ~/.bash_profile

insert:

export PATH="$PATH:/home/user1/FolderforPath"

alwyas remember that the syntax $PATH is mandatory. If you delete it any command will work.

(you can also do: PATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder  but is not recommended as your path into PATH will be considerend only in your current bash session
(if you open another one you will not able to have that path included) and without " " spaces inside names will not be considered) 


now refresh

source ~/.bash_profile

You can add whichever folder you wish to the path!

_______________________________________

In the worst case scenario in which you mess up with the PATH, just type:

export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"

it will add the correct folder to the path and all the system commands will work.
It will be just for 1 session.
You have to restore the PATH at the previous state before closing the session.
