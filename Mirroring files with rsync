Rsync is a tool similar to Robocopy in microsoft
rsync works in Linux but also in Mac

to mirror just use:


rsync -vr --delete foldersource/ folderdestination/


with -v is verbose
-r is recursive

--delete is an option that allows to delete folders not available in the
destination folder

foldersource/ and folderdestination/ are
the corrispondent source and destination folders

REMEMBER! Always use the '/' at the end of the name of the folder
in that way you will copy just the content.
if you don't put the slash you will copy the entire folder
with all the container

if you use -z you can compress them

with --progress you can see the progress
