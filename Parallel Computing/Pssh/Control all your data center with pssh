Pssh is a python package that allows to run commands via ssh to all your machines at once

at the moment (pssh version 2.3.1 and Python 3.7.3) the package is broken and you need to do some small fixs to the code in order to make it work
(or the other solution is to downgrade python)

First install it via pip

pip install pssh

then you can type

pssh --version

if there is some error like 'Traceback no module Version' or something like that then you need to do the first change to the code

first open the file that is indicated in the error

/home/$USER/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/psshlib/cli.py

then just change in the first lines

import version

to:

from . import version

save and exit
