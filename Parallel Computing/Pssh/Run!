now we can run indicating the list of hosts on which run the particular command that we want:

pssh -i -h ~/.pssh_hosts_files  mycommand

e.g. we can query the uptim with:

pssh -i -h ~/.pssh_hosts_files  uptime

the command will run the 'uptime' command on any host via ssh and will print the output

There will be also a '[SUCCESS]' printed output if the command has successfully been executed
