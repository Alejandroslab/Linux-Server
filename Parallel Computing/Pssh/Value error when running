The other error that you may incurr is this one:

/usr/bin/pssh -H 127.0.0.1 df -h
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/pssh", line 118, in <module>
do_pssh(hosts, cmdline, opts)
File "/usr/bin/pssh", line 71, in do_pssh
manager = Manager(opts)
File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/psshlib/manager.py", line 42, in __init__
self.iomap = IOMap()
File "/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/psshlib/manager.py", line 215, in __init__
signal.set_wakeup_fd(wakeup_writefd)
ValueError: the fd 4 must be in non-blocking mode


to fix this you have to open the file indicated that is:

 /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/psshlib/manager.py

 (if you have installed via pip this file will be located under 'local'. Anyways the path will be very similar)

 then first on the import section of the code add:

import fcntl

 Then go to line 213 (use vim) and add this line:

 fcntl.fcntl(wakeup_writefd, fcntl.F_SETFL, os.O_NONBLOCK)

 save and exit

 now pssh should work
