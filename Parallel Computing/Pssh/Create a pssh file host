Now for speed reasons you may want to create a file that will be recalled with pssh

(you will have to type in any host if you do not do this step)

You can create it as an hidden file:

vim .pssh_hosts_files

inside the file just type in the list of hosts in the 'ssh' way:

myuser@myhost
myuser@myhost2
myuser@myhost3


save and exit
