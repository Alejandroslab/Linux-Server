Install Jupyter lab after having installed Jupyter notebook! Not before

To install you have several ways
I have used the conda installer without activating any environment

conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab


DONE!

Now repeat the process of the connection with the ssh tunneling

and just run:

jupyter lab

(separated by a space)

Another URL will be printed, paste it in your local browser and voila'
You will se the Jupyter Notebook with Terminal, Console that is the Jupyter Lab!
