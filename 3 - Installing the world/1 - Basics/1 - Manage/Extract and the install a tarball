To extract just use:

tar -zxvf mypackage.tar.gz

or if you want to extract in another folder just move with 'cd'

like

cd /home/me

then launch

tar -zxvf /media/me/mypackage.tar.gz

if you have mounted a cd or usb or HD to your pc


now to install you have to find the right package 

for exampl for cassandra you have to run

/bin/cassandra

or you just move to the 'bin' directory and then run

./cassandra
