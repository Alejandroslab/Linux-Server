vim /etc/apt/sources.list

Many Linux distributions divide repositories into separate categories. For instance,
Ubuntu breaks out its repository categories as follows:
main Contains supported open source software
universe Contains community­maintained open source software
multiverse Contains software restricted by copyright or other legal issues
restricted Contains proprietary device drivers
backports Contains packages from later releases


To add a repository, just edit the sources.list file by adding the name of the repository
to the list and then save the file. Say, for example, you want to install Oracle Java 8 on
Kali. No apt package for Oracle Java 8 is available as part of the default Kali sources,
but a quick search online shows that the fine folk at WebUpd8 have created one. If you
add their repository to the sources, you can then install Oracle Java 8 with the apt-get
install oracle-java8-installer command.

At the time of writing, you would need to add
the following repository locations to sources.list in order to add the necessary
repositories:deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main
deb­src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main
