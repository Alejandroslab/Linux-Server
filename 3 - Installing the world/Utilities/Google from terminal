just install googler (FOSS)

you should install with snap because the version with 'apt' seems to not work properly

Therefore

sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade


sudo apt install snapd


now:

sudo snap install googler

now to run with snap type:

snap run googler

another way to run is to add the snap folder to our PATH




if you have the other version install with apt that is 'sudo apt install googler'

then remove it within

sudo apt purge googler
