 Edit .bashrc and add the following lines:

export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop

export PATH=${PATH}:${HADOOP_HOME}/bin:${HADOOP_HOME}/sbin



The second line will add the binary directory to the PATH that is a file in which all folders with executable are indicated
to check this PATH file:

echo $PATH

then you should run:

source ~/.bashrc
to make your changes persistant



If you have messed up with your PATH you may want to check the other files like: .profile or .bash_profile
You will see there other programs that maybe you have previously added.

in .bash_profile you have to open and paste:

export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/hadoop/bin"

save and exit then eventually run:

source .bash_profile
