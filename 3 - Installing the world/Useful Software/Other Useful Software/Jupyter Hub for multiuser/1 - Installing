We will perform the installation via pip and not conda!


First install python3 and pip


sudo apt install python3-pip

then node js and npm:

sudo apt install nodejs npm

Then install jupyter hub:

python3 -m pip install jupyterhub

install the proxy:

npm install -g configurable-http-proxy

Finally:

python3 -m pip install jupyterlab notebook

# needed if running the notebook servers in the same environment

 You can test your installation with the commands:

 jupyterhub -h
configurable-http-proxy -h
