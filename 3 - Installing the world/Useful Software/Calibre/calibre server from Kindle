just take your kindle

open the experimental web browser

just go to

http://xxxxxx:8080/mobile

where xxxxxx is the calibre server name (hostname) or the ip address

remember to add '/mobile'
this will link to the mobile version of calibre, a lightweight version that even the kindle's experimental browser will be able to manage

with this version even authentication will work!

(if you forgot the '/mobile' calibre will not display in kindle. it will continue to load but will never end..)


anyways, it will not you allow to read from the browser but will download a copy directly to you home kindle
the format of the book should be .mobi or .txt, other format (as .epub) will not be supported and you will not be able to download

the other limitation is that it will be possible to interact only with 25 items while the other will be seens as a list of titles and images

anyways the search function will allow to search from all the calibre libraryr database and you will be able to download the book who you are looking for,
even if it does not appear in the first 25 elements. (By the way it should be formatted in the formats supported like .mobi)

Finally it supports more than one library 
You can change library at the bottom of the page
