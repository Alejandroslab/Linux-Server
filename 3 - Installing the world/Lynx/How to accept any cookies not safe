Most of the lynx.cfg usual locations are /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg or /etc/lynx.cfg as of time of writting this post in Debian Squeeze GNU / Linux the lynx.cfg is located in /etc/lynx-cur/lynx.cfg, whether for FreeBSD / NetBSD / OpenBSD users the file is located in /usr/local/etc/lynx.cfg

What I did to allow all cookies is open lynx.cfg in vim edit and change the following lines:

a)

#FORCE_SSL_COOKIES_SECURE:FALSE
with

FORCE_SSL_COOKIES_SECURE:TRUE
b)

#SET_COOKIES:TRUE
uncomment it to:

SET_COOKIES:TRUE
c) next, change

ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES:FALSE
ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES:TRUE
