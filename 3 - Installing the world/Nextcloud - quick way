sudo snap install nextcloud

to check installation

snap changes nextcloud

finally just go to your browser and type in the hostname or ip without indicating any port

from there you can finalize the installation it will prompt to create a new administrative user and a password


done!

then you can create users within the web interface


finally if you are under a vpn you may not be able to ping '.local'

you may want to use the ip of the machine to get there

to get the list of ip and domains of your nextcloud server:
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:get trusted_domains

if you machine has ip like : 192.168.1.10

then you can add it with this command:

sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 2 --value=192.168.1.10

the '2' indicates that this will be placed in second row of the file 
usually the first row is the 'hostname.local' domain 

use '2' because if you use '1' you will overwrite the first line 

to delete e rule:

sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:delete trusted_domains 2 


the changes have immediately effect
