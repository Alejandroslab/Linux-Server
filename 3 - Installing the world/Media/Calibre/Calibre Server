Install

sudo apt update

then

sudo apt install -y libfontconfig libgl1-mesa-glx


REMEMBER: you can explicit more than one command with '&&'

so it could be:

sudo apt update &&  sudo apt install -y libfontconfig libgl1-mesa-glx

Now download calibre:

wget https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.sh

sudo sh linux-installer.sh

DONE!


now: to create an EMPTY LIBRARY:
Now download a book (it will be necessary to create the right config. files (.db) in calibre)

wget http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46.kindle.noimages -O christmascarol.mobi


create a directory for calibre (it will be the directory of calibre)

mkdir calibre-library

add all mobi books (included the one downloaded):

calibredb add *.mobi --with-library calibre-library/

this last command will allow to create the 'metadata.db' file
that will define the structure of the library for calibre

(Now, if you have firewall enabled than you have to add a rule for the program and the port
sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw status)

then run the server as defined below


TO USE A PREXISTING LIBRARY:
you can skip all the previous steps if you have
an existing library

In this case just copy your folder wherever you want
(like your home folder) (remember to leave
your metadata.db file and to not delete it)
and then directly run the server:


Now RUN THE SERVER:

calibre-server calibre-library

if you want to load another library at the same time just type:

calibre-server calibre-library library2

and so on (if you want more than 2):

calibre-server calibre-library library2 library3  ....


you can e.g. have two libraries one for fiction and one for science:

calibre-server fiction science

(you can add the '-library' suffix but is just to remember that they are
calibre libraries but it is not mandatory)


REMEMEBER! if you want to export a library from a calibre server
to another (or from any calibre instance to a calibre server)
you just have to copy the calibre library folders with all
your books inside and check to copy and NOT DELETE
the file 'metadata.db' where is stored all the metadata
that allow to calibre server to use the folder as a
calibre library.

therefore if you want to export a library
you just have to copy the folder as when will use the
command:

calibre-server fiction science

calibre will recognize the libraries based on the
preexisting metadata.db file.





Now you can access the library from a client. Open a browser and type:

IP:8080
or
hostname:8080




Ok! done
press ctrl+c to stop the process

now let's create a service in order to run calibre-server
in background


CALIBRE SERVER IN BACKGROUND

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/calibre-server.service

ADD THESE LINES:

## startup service
[Unit]
Description=calibre content server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=UTENTE
Group=UTENTE (oppure inserire sudo se l'utente ha privilegi)
ExecStart=/opt/calibre/calibre-server /home/UTENTE/calibre-library --enable-local-write

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


REMEMBER to correctly indicate the path
(with the correct user) and the name of the folder
that will be loaded as a calibre library.

REMEMBER! If you want to load more than one calibre library
simply change the line:

ExecStart=/opt/calibre/calibre-server /home/UTENTE/calibre-library --enable-local-write

and add the other paths of your libraries like here:
(in this case I will add another library called 'library2')

ExecStart=/opt/calibre/calibre-server /home/UTENTE/calibre-library /home/UTENTE/library2 --enable-local-write

(if you want to make this changes you have to stop
the service with the usual command:
sudo systemctl stop calibre-server)




Save and close the file.
Now enable the service and start it:

sudo systemctl enable calibre-server
sudo systemctl start calibre-server

you can use also this:

sudo systemctl enable calibre-server && sudo systemctl start calibre-server

Eventually reboot all the system
sudo reboot






ADD USERS:
you can also add users:
first stop the server:

sudo systemctl stop calibre-server

then add:

calibre-server --manage-users

add a new user (choose 1) and choose an username and password
It will ask twice the password.

You will then see:

Output
User mycalibreuser added successfully!



now reopen the config file

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/calibre-server.service
and add --enable-auth to this line:

ExecStart=/opt/calibre/calibre-server /home/UTENTE/calibre-library --enable-local-write --enable-auth

Now restart (whenever you change the file you have to restart both the daemon that includes the service and then the calibre-server itself (not the
service but the program itself))

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start calibre-server

_______________________
in the case that you need to deaticvate the authentication:

sudo systemctl stop calibre-server.service


remember that you have to stop just the service thati is 'calibre-server.service' not 'calibre-server'!

now open the Service

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/calibre-server.service

and delete the "--enable-auth" part

save the file.

Now if you check the status of the service:

sudo systemctl status calibre-server.service

you will see the message:
The unit file, source configuration file or drop-ins of calibre-server.service changed on disk. Run 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload units.
‚óè calibre-server.service - calibre content server

therefore we have to restart the daemon and then calibre-server:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

now daemon has been reloaded. anyways it will stay still inactive. you can check this with:

sudo systemctl status calibre-server.service

therefore just reload the program:

sudo systemctl start calibre-server

now if you check with 'status' you will get the service as running


REMEMBER! you cannot access this resource if you activate a vpn client service on
your client pc
_________________________________


You can then connect BookCut folder to cron to add automatically all the books from BookCut

to install BookCut (for all users)

sudo pip install bookcut

if you not put 'sudo' at the beginning it will not be possible to retrieve the program



(if you have Anaconda just activate your environment)
conda activate my_environment


In Debian you have to install pip first. This divides in pip2 or pip3 depending on the version of python that you want to user

therefore:

sudo pip3 install bookcut

if you wrongly just type

pip3 install bookcut

without 'sudo' then you can remove the package with the commands

pip3 uninstall bookcut


SOME COMMANDS:

output the results and download e-book:
bookcut search -t 'Homer Odyssey'

bookcut book -b "White Fang" -a "Jack London"
