sudo systemctl start apache2

error:

Starting web server apache2 (98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:8585 (98)Address already in use: 
AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:8000 no listening sockets available, shutting down 
AH00015: Unable to open logs Action 'start' failed. The Apache error log may have more information.

to fix this check:

grep -ri listen /etc/apache2

and kill the process that is using the port

sudo kill 30010

where 30010 is the PID that is printed after the grep command
