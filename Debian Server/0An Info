The downloaded version is Debian Stable (10 'Buster')

Download the 'amd64' version that is the default one.

Debian testing is another version with also another name ('Bullseye')

In Debian, contrary on what happens on Ubuntu, there is nothing installed except
the very core packages.

Therefore you may need to install more stuff than usual if compared to Ubuntu

But this is the good thing about Debian. You will have a Linux Server OS
without any unnecessary package

However in Debian there are not some important packages like:

sudo

Therefore any command that you will run will not have the need to run with 'sudo'
like sudo apt-get update would become:

apt-get update

Debian always work as root initially. You can install sudo if you want but Debian
will not install it by default.

nano, openssh

Some useful packages are not installed as mentioned. You have to install them manually

There will not be even the usual 'home' folder.
You have to create it by yourself like the 'Documents, Photos, Downloads, Videos' folders if you need them.
