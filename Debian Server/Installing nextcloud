We will proceed without snapd repositories (I don't trust them)

we will use the usual repos of debian
The installation process is a bit easier than the installation on raspbian
although is little more long than in Ubuntu

1) first!

Install Apache webserver

 sudo apt update -y

  sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php -y

  After installation check the Apache status:

  systemctl status apache2

  2) second

  Install php and some dependencies


  sudo apt-get install -y php php-gd php-curl php-zip php-dom php-xml php-simplexml php-mbstring -y

  verify the installation with:

  php -V

  IF YOU GET ERRORS WHILE TRYING TO ACCESS THE NEXTCLOUD
  WEBPAGE THEN YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE CORRECT VERSION OF PHP
  AND THEN RESTART THE APACHE SERVER THIS way:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install php7.3
  sudo apt install php7.3-gd php7.3-json php7.3-mysql php7.3-curl php7.3-mbstring php7.3-intl php-imagick php7.3-xml php7.3-zip


  sudo service apache2 restart


  3) install mysql

  sudo  apt install mysql-server php-mysql -y

  remember that if you have already installed it will be skipped as you have already it in your system


to check status of mysql run

sudo systemctl status mysql

next login to mysql

mysql -u root -p


4) create a database in mysql:

CREATE DATABASE nextclouddb;

5) create a user :

CREATE USER 'nextcloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

you must put a strong password instead of the word password (but leave the single quotes)
be careful with the quotes! leave it as you see it

6)Grant privileges to this user

GRANT ALL ON nextclouddb.* TO 'nextcloud'@'localhost';

6b) now flush

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

6C) and exit

EXIT

7) Now donwload nextcloud

cd /tmp

wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-21.0.1.zip

8) unzip

 unzip nextcloud-21.0.1.zip

 9) move the unzipped to the web root:

 sudo mv nextcloud /var/www/html


10)Navigate to the document root folder  and change the file ownership to www-data .

cd /var/www/html

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud

11) Also, change the file permissions as shown

sudo chmod -R 755 nextcloud

12) now open in a broswer

http://ipaddress_or_hostname/nextcloud

Now just create the admin account inserting an username and a mypassword

in 'Database User' 'Database password' and 'Database name' just put the ones
typed before defining the SQL DATABASE
therefore:

user: nextcloud
password: mypassword
database name: nextclouddb

now just wait some minutes and it will finally open!

DONE!

_____________
WHERE MY DATA WILL BE STORE?
your data will be stored here:

/var/www/html/nextcloud/data

you can also extend capacity within Nextcloud itself
there is in fact an internal app
that allows to expand storage pointing to some external devices
like another NAS




_______________
TROUBLESHOOTING
PHP ERROR
if you get the error in the webpage with 'No database drivers (sqlite, mysql, postgre)'
then you can fix it installing the correct version of php
and restarting apache webserver (see above in the point of php insstallation)

ERROR WHILE TRYING TO CREATE ADMIN USER
"Error while trying to create admin user: Failed to connect to the database: An exception occurred in the driver:
SQLSTATE[HY000] [2054]
The server requested authentication method unknown
to the client"

This is an error due to a change in the authetincation settings done by msql
and appearing since mysql 8.0.2

to fix this you basically have to change the authentication method wiht the mysql_native_password
if you have already created the mysql user then change the password with this command:

ALTER USER 'nextcloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
