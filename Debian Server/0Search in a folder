if you need to search a folder:


find /home/myuser/myfolder -type d | grep "directory name"

wildcards also are available that means that you can look folder


find /home/myuser/myfolder -type d | grep "nam*"

will retrieve all directory whose title starts with nam..


in case you need a file:

find /home/myuser/myfolder -type f | grep "file name"


just change the option from directory (d) to file (f)
