the best option is:

  sudo apt install ./name.deb
  (doing this it will try also to download an install all dependencies)

or you can just use the command dpkg and the option 'install'
that is '-i'

in this way:

sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb

When you use apt to install a package, under the hood it uses dpkg. When you install a package using apt, it first creates a list of all the dependencies and downloads it from the repository.

Once the download is finished it calls dpkg to install all those files, satisfying all the dependencies.


You can install a deb file with:

    sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
    sudo apt-get install -f

  or:
    sudo apt install ./name.deb

    Or:

    sudo apt install /path/to/package/name.deb

    With old apt-get versions you must first move your deb file to /var/cache/apt/archives/ directory. For both, after executing this command, it will automatically download its dependencies.

    First installing gdebi and then opening your .deb file using it (Right-click -> Open with). It will install your .deb package with all its dependencies.

    Note: APT maintains the package index which is a database of available packages available in repo defined in /etc/apt/sources.list file and in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. All these methods will fail to satisfy the software dependency if the dependencies required by the deb is not present in the package index.
