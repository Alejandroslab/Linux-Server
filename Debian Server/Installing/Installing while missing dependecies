if you want to install a package and
the terminal says that there are some missing dependencies
(it will state the packages names) then just launch this afterwards:


sudo apt --fix-broken install

this command will automatically retrieve all missind dependencies
and install all at once!

if you have installed something with missing dependencies
and run the command, that package will be removed
