in debian you may need to install non free components
that basically are drivers fror some old propietary hardware
like an external wifi adapter
first thing to do: do not connect your hardware
beacuse you need to install the non free components first.



in order to install the non free copmonents you can do this
updating the sources list
opening:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

and adding

deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ buster main contrib non-free

where 'buster' is the version name of Debian 10
(you will need to change this name accordingly to
the Debian version like 'stretch' for Debian 9 or 'jessie' for Debian 8)

then:

sudo apt-get update

and (from Debian 9 and next versions):

sudo apt-get install firmware-misc-nonfree

now you can connect your hardware (like
an external wifi adapter)
(this is the case for example for Dlink DWA 125 Wifi external adapter)
