If you cannot isntall anything like if you have the error:
'Unable to locate package nameofpackage'

and this happens for anything you want to install you have to check your sources

to do that:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

The main Apt sources configuration file is at /etc/apt/sources.list. You can edit this files (as root) using your favorite text editor.

To add custom sources, creating separate files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ is preferred.

then you can check the content of the file if these line are missing:

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ buster main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ buster main

You have to add them then save and close

If you don't add them, the system will only download the security updates..


after adding them just run:

sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get updgrade -y

then you will be able again to install packages.
