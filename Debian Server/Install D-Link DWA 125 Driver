You have to download the correct component /package:

https://wiki.debian.org/rt2800usb

Add a "non-free" component to /etc/apt/sources.list, for example:

# Debian 8 "Jessie"
deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

# Debian 9 "Stretch"
deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free


Update the list of available packages:

# apt-get update

then from Debian 9 and the next versions:

# apt-get install firmware-misc-nonfree

Connect the device to your system. The rt2800usb kernel module is automatically loaded for supported devices.

Configure your wireless interface as appropriate.
