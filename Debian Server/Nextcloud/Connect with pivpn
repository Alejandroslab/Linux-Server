if you connect with Windows you may have some
troubles as you have to manually change your dns
in order to resolve the hostnames

this means that in your broswer

http://mylinuxserver/nextcloud

will not work
you will instead use the suffix provided by your router

http://mylinuxserver.local/nextcloud

or:

http://mylinuxserver.local/nextcloud

or it will work the ip:

http://192.168.1.320/nextcloud


in order to fix this you may want to change this in your
config files

this does not occur in MacOs
