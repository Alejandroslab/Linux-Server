if you connect with Windows you may have some
troubles as you have to manually change your dns
in order to resolve the hostnames

this means that in your broswer

http://mylinuxserver/nextcloud

will not work
you will instead use the suffix provided by your router

http://mylinuxserver.local/nextcloud

or:

http://mylinuxserver.local/nextcloud

or it will work the ip:

http://192.168.1.320/nextcloud


in order to fix this you may want to change this in your
config files:

/etc/openvpn/server.conf
Around line 18 you'll find a line like
 push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8",
 just change that and restart the openvpn service like this:

sudo systemctl restart openvpn

this does not occur in MacOs
