If you connect in another local wifi there may be some connectivity issues and conflicts
this happens when the remote wifi network use the same ip addresses than your local network

example:
the VPN server is inside a network with

192.168.1.0/24

and the client that is trying to connect uses the same addresses in its network:

192.168.1.0/24

this will generate a conflict that will result in a 100% of data loss when pinging



therefore it is suggested to connect to a mobile wifi (e.g. an hotspot)
or to a public wifi

but there should be solution for this..!
actually there is of course!

a workaround is setting up a NAT in order to hide the real local ip's
of both the network
this could be set up in both the newtork or just in one side
anyways this means some probably hard work to do...

therefore the easiest solution to this problem (called 'overlapping IPs' or 'overlapping networks during vpn')
is to change the subnet of the server (as it will be more practical rather than asking the clients
to change their subnets..)
