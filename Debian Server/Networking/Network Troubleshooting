First you have to know the name of your network interface

to do that just

cat /etc/network/interfaces

this will display your network interfaces
remember that the loopback is a testing network interfaces..
you have to choose one of the other interfaces

Let's say we choose the 'eth0'

now we can restart the network interface running:

sudo /sbin/dhclient eth0

done!
the interface will restart and your netwokr will be back to work!
