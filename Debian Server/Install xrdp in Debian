simply:
sudo apt-get install xrdp

now this will automatically run

check the status with

sudo systemctl status xrdp

now xrdp uses a particular key file which is readable only by users that
are member of the ssl-cert group
therefore we will add the xrdp user to the group:

sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert

DONE!
