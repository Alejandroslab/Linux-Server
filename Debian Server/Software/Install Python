In Debian you will have to build Python from source:


update as usual
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

install dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl libbz2-dev

install wget if you don't have it
sudo apt-get install wget


now get the last tar python file from the official website:

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/Python-3.9.2.tgz


extract the gzipped archive with:

tar -xf Python-3.9.2.tgz

now move to the folder
cd Python-3.9.2

run 'configure' file the option '--enable-optimizations'
will perform consistency test while building the python binary
(will check if dependecies are available. it will take some time)

./configure --enable-optimizations


run

nproc

to know the number of processors of your machine

now:

make -j 2

where j is the number of cores. it will allow you to get
more speed while building

When the build process will end install python binaries

sudo make altinstall

'altinstall' is used because later it will overwrite then
default system python3 binary

DONE!

check your version with:

python3.9 --version


you can run python with

python3.9

DONE!

(if you need pip you will need to install it separately)
