Debian users should replace all instances
of usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep with  /lib/systemd/system-sleep/

to create a script to run before suspending:

nano /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/pre-suspend.sh

type inside:

#!/bin/bash/
if [ "${1}" == "pre" ]; then
sh /path/to/script/to/run.sh
elif [ "${1}" == "post" ]; then
# nothing goes here
fi

where /path/to/script/to/run.sh is a shell script
that also start with

#!/bin/bash/

and that is made executable with:

sudo chmod +x run.sh

to create a script to run before resuming:
#!bin/bash
if [ "${1}" == "pre" ]; then
# nothing goes here
elif [ "${1}" == "post" ]; then
sh /path/to/script/to/run.sh
fi

where
/path/to/script/to/run.sh is the script to run
