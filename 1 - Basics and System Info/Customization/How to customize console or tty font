You can change the console or tty font 

to check it you can temporary change your tty pressing ctrl+alt+f2 or f3 



on Arch linux just go to 

cd /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts

then list all the fonts and choose one

Usually on Manjaro the Terminus font comes available 

(or you can install with sudo pacman -Syu terminus-font) 

therefore we can change the font with:

setfont ter-232b.psf.gz 

(or just use sudo)

Remember that this is a temporary solution.

To make it permanent just create a new config file:

sudo vim /etc/vconsole.conf

and type:

FONT=ter-232b.psf.gz
