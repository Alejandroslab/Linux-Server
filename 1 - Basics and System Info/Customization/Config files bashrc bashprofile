You may have come across some tutorials where they say to put your configuration either in the .bashrc, .bash_profile 
or another configuration file that is read and executed by the bash shell.


When invoked as an interactive login shell, Bash looks for the /etc/profile file, and if the file exists , it runs the commands listed in the file. Then Bash searches for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile files, in the listed order, and executes commands from the first readable file found.

When Bash is invoked as an interactive non-login shell, it reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists, and it is readable.

Difference Between .bashrc and .bash_profile
.bash_profile is read and executed when Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, while .bashrc is executed for an interactive non-login shell.

Use .bash_profile to run commands that should run only once, such as customizing the $PATH environment variable .

Put the commands that should run every time you launch a new shell in the .bashrc file. 

This include your aliases and functions , custom prompts, history customizations , and so on.
