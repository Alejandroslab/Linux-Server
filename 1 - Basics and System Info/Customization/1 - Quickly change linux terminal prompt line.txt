remember finally to save it and logout and login again to make it permanent 

alternatively you can just use them temporarily with:

export PS1="\W &gt; "

you can also change colors with:


export PS1="\e[0;32m[\u@\h \W]\$ \e[0m"


Your prompt should have the same text as normal but be colored green.

Here’s a breakdown of the commands:

• \e[ – Begin color changes
• 0;32m – Specify the color code
• [\u@\h \W]\$ – This is the code for your normal BASH prompt (username@hostname Workingdirectory $)
• \e[0m – Exit color-change mode

The first number in the color code specifies the typeface:

• 0 – Normal
• 1 – Bold (bright)
• 2 – Dim
• 4 – Underlined

The second number indicates the color you want:

• 30 – Black
• 31 – Red
• 32 – Green
• 33 – Brown
• 34 – Blue
• 35 – Purple
• 36 – Cyan
• 37 – Light gray

to revert the changes when you have changed the bashrc file just use your backup

sudo cp ~/.bashrc.bak ~/.bashrc
