The welcome message is the message that appears when you login (MOTD : (Message of the Day))


you must inspect the files: 

  /etc/motd
  /run/motd.dynamic
  /etc/init.d/motd



motd can also be dynamic that means that is a result of another script (that is stored here:/etc/update-motd.d/ and is composed by 
several files that you can change as you wish)

If you change one of those files you will have your welcome message changed!

If for any reason MOTD does not show up check this:

The file in /etc/ssh/sshd_config needed to be set this line UsePAM yes. 

That allowed the interactive login to trigger the file 

/etc/pam.d/sshd that may contain this line:

session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic 

to run, which in turn ran the files in /etc/update-motd.d/ to trigger the MOTD

If the line is not in the file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

then just append it at the end of the file :

session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic

you can change the path of the MOTD with any of the 3 common paths:
  /etc/motd
  /run/motd.dynamic
  /etc/init.d/motd
  
  save and exit done!
