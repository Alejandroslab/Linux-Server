just run:

lsblk

or:

fdisk -l

you can also list your devices:

ls /dev



remember

sda corresponds to first SATA drive
sdb to second SATA drive
sdc to third
sdd to fourth and so on..

usually drives are splitted in partitions
so you will have

sda1, sda2 as the first and the second partition of the first SATA drive
