PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/myscripts

this will append the path after the ':' to the current PATH list of directories

doing so will giver you the possibilty to run your scripts inside the folder 'myscripts'


to show all the paths of the PATH variable just run:

echo $PATH
every path will be separated by a ':'

to run it with every path on a newline just run:
echo "${PATH//:/$'\n'}"

or:
echo "${PATH//:/\n}"


DO NOT ADD TO MUCH DIRECTORIES TO YOUR PATH as it will slow down the system
