just run the command on shell:

HISTSIZE=0

this will set your history file at 0. this means that the shell will not record any command you run

thisis temporarily if you want to make it permanent just use 'export'

export HISTSIZE in this case


this means run:

HISTSIZE=0
export HISTSIZE

you can also make some backup running

echo $HISTSIZE > mybackuphistsize.txt

or also all the environment variables with:

set > mybackupenvironmentvariable.txt


anyways you can come back to the default values (that in this case is 1000) running again:

HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTSIZE
