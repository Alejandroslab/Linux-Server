grep -R --exclude-dir=dir1 'some pattern' /path/to/search

where dir1 is an internal directory in your current working folder ($pwd)




you can also indicate multiple folders with curly brackets:

grep -R --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,dir3} 'some pattern' /path/to/search

If you are in your current directory:

grep -R --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,dir3} 'some pattern' .


REMEMBER YOU CANNOT USE CURLY BRACKETS WITH JUST 1 FOLDER, YOU HAVE TO USE AT LEAST 2
