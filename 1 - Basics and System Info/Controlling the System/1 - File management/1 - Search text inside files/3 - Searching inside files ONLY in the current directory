In Bash, a glob will not expand into hidden files, so if you want to search all the files in a directory, you need to specify hidden files .* and non-hidden *


grep -s "string" * .*

If you are searching files in another dir:

grep -s "string" /path/to/dir/{*,.*}

(if you want to find files by their file name inside the current directory just use find)

find myfile
