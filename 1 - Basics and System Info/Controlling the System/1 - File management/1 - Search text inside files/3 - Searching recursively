Will allow to search in all the subdirectories:

grep -R 'some pattern' /path/to/search

(REMEMBER you cannot specify the path if you do not add the -R option)

if the path is the same in which you are working just put the dot:


grep -R 'my words to search' .



Look for all files in the current directory and in all of its subdirectories in Linux for the word ‘httpd’:


grep -R 'httpd' .


grep -irnw '/home/user/myfolder' -e "mywords" 

-i ignore case
-r recursive
-n show line numbers 
-w word-regexp
-e set the pattern 

finally you can pipe it to a new file:

grep -irnw '/home/user/myfolder' -e "mywords"  > myoutput.csv
