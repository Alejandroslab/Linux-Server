Grep is a command that retrieves text INSIDE FILES 

It can search for a word or term inside files
But with piping you can broadly extend its functionality



grep "myword" myfile

You can use single quote '' or double quotes alternatively "" (it's the same)


You can also omit the quotes (if the searched term/s have not spaces):

grep myword myfile


REMEMBER THAT THE WORDS YOU ARE SEARCHING ARE CASE SENSITIVE

To perform a case-insensitive (ignore-case) search for the word ‘bar’ inside the file called 'file1':

grep -i 'bar' file1

THE OPTION CAN ALSO BE PLACED AT THE END OF THE COMMAND like:

grep 'bar' file1 -i 



Grep also DOES NOT SUPPORT wildcards but RegEx

You do not need to specify the position with wildcards like *. Grep will perform that automatically
