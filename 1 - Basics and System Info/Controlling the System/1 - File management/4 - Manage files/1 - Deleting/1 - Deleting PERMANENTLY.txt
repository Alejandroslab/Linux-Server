This command will delete and overwrite multiple times the file 

shred myfile 

On its own, shred will delete the file and overwrite it several times—by default, shred
overwrites four times. 

The more times the file is overwritten, the harder it is
to recover, but keep in mind that each overwrite takes time, so for very large files,
shredding may become time­consuming.

shred -f -n 10 myfile 

-f will force it. this means will change the permissions if needed 
-n 10 option sets the times that the file will be overwritten 


you can also add -z option for zero fill
