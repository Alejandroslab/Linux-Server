find . -maxdepth 1 -not -path '*/.*' -type f |head -10 | xargs cp -t mytests



this will find all files inside the current '.' directory and copy the first 10 ones in a folder called 'mytests'

then the max depth will be just 1 folder (it will not look inside suboflders)

hidden files will be excluded (-not -path predicate)
