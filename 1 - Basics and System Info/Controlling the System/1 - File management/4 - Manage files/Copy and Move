Command

cp file folder

example

cp test.txt /home/user1/destioationfolder



BUT!
when you have to copy a folder you have to add -r option (recursive. that
means that will copy all the files of the folder)

cp -r myfolder /home/user1


in order to see progresses just use the verbose option
that is '-v'

cp -v -r folder1 /home/user1

you can also join option and type them at the end of the command:

cp  folder1 /home/user1 -vr




if you need 2 files or folder just:

cp file1 file2 /home/user1/destinationfolder

for folders:

cp -r folder1 folder 2 /home/user1


to move:


mv file folder

to move more than 1 item:


cp file file2 destination_folder

if you need to copy or move a large folder
you may want to see your progress (otherwise you will get
only a stuck cursor)


in order to see progresses just use the verbose option

mv -v -r folder1 /home/user1


Alternatively you can merge option in one single option doing this

mv -vr folder1 /home/user1
