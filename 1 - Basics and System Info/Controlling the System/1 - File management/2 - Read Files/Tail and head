To print the last n rows of a file use tail

To print the first n rows of a file use head

tail -n 4 /etc/group

We can even open multiple files using tail command with out need to execute multiple tail commands to view multiple files. Suppose if you want to see first two lines of a

tail -n <number of lines> <file1> <file2> <file3>


Unlike the default behaviour which is to end after printing certain number of lines,
the -f option “which stands for follow” will keep the stream going.
It will start printing extra lines on to console added to the file after it is opened.

This command will keep the file open to display updated changes to console until the user breaks the command.

tail -f /path/to/file


service crond start ; tail -f /var/log/cron


The same tail -f command can be replicated using less command well. Once you open a file with less

less /path/to/filename

Once you open file, then press shift+f

Example:

Mar 21 08:25:01 sanne-taggle CRON[5553]: (root) CMD (command -v debian-sa1 > /dev/null && debian-sa1 1 1)Mar 21 08:27:24 sanne-taggle wpa_supplicant[807]: wlan0: WPA: Group rekeying completed with da:3c:69:04:b1:21 [GTK=CCMP]Mar 21 08:35:01 sanne-taggle CRON[5982]: (root) CMD (command -v debian-sa1 > /dev/null && debian-sa1 1 1)Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
In order to come out from update mode in less, you have to press ctrl+c and then press q for quit.




We have other option -s  which should always be used with -f” will determine the sleep interval, whereas tail -f will keep watching the file, the refresh rate is each 1 second, if you wish to control this, then you will have to use the -s option “sleep” and specify the sleep interval

tail -f -s <sleep interval in seconds> /path/to/file



As we seen in example 3, We can open more files using tail command. Even we can view 2 files at the same time growing using -f option as well. It will also print a header viewing which file is showing this output. the header line will be beginning with “==>”

tail /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2


Now what if I have a very huge /var/log/messages and I am only interested in the last certain number of bytes of data, the -c option can do this easily. observe the below example where I want to view only the last 500 bytes of data from /var/log/messages

tail -c <number of bytes> /path/to/file



HEAD:

Head command will obviously on the contrary to tail, it will print the first 10 lines of the file.
