Let's say we want to count the columsn (divided by a space) in a command like ls:

ls -lah

just add this:

ls -lah | awk '{print NF}' | sort -nu | tail -n 1

the awk will retrieve all the columns and print the number of columns for any row
sort -nu will operate a distinct like operation

tail -n 1 will retrieve the second row
