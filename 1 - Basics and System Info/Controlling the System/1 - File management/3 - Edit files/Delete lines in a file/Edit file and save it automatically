This is called edit in place and you can perform it with the '-i' option:

this command will delete the last line of the file 'test.txt'


sed -i '$d' test.txt



This will also automtically save it 





CAREFUL. In macOS this command will not work as macos requires a backup of the file.


sed -i '.bak' '$d' test.txt

This command will create a file 'test.txt.bak' that will be the backup file of 'test.txt'




If you do not want to save a backup just run sed with an empty '':


sed -i '' '$d' test.txt
