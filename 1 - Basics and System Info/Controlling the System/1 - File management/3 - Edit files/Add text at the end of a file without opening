this command will append a line of text in a file without opening

echo "the text that I will append" >> myfile




You may wonder if you can use it to quickly edit your hosts file but you cannot do that (at least not in macos)

as it will complain that you have not the permissions



you have to use 'tee' and piping:


echo "the text that I will append" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

then will work
