you can use touch

touch myfile

or cat


cat > myfile

When you press ENTER , Linux will go into interactive mode and wait for you to start
entering content for the file.

This can be puzzling because the prompt disappears, but if
you simply begin typing, whatever you enter will go into the file

To exit and return to the prompt, I press CTRL Â­D.

to append something

cat >> myfile

type your text and press ctrl + d
