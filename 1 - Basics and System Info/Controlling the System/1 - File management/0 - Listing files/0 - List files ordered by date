just add -t option or -r for reverse order

ls -t will order by 'time last modified' (descending)


if you add an -r you will get the ascending order:

ls -tr

you can also use it with full-time option

ls --full-time -t *

this will retrieve all the files ordered in descending order (the asterisk will delete the first row that displays the total size of files )
