sudo chmod 777 myfile.txt

will change the permission to 7 (that stands for 'rwx') to every set (owner, group and other user)

you can use also the UGO method (where UGO stands for User (or owner), Group and Other users)

to grant execution permission to User and Other user:

chmod u+x, o+x myfile.txt

to remove write permission to User

chmod u-w myfile.txt
