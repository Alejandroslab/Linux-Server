ls -l

There are three sets of three
characters, made of some combination of read ( r ), write ( w ), and execute ( x ), in that
order.

The first set represents the permissions of the owner;
the second, those of the group;
and the last, those of all other users.


If any r , w , or x is replaced with a
dash ( - ), then the respective permission hasnâ€™t been given. Note that users can have
permission to execute only either binaries or scripts.


binary: 111 is equal to octal '7' and to 'rwx'
this pattern will repeat fort the 3 sets: owner, group and other Users
therefore 777 will mean grant permision 'rwx' or '7' to all the 3 sets: owner, group and other users
