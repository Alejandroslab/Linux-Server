If the user doesn't remember their password you need to reset it. To do this you need to boot into recovery mode (see also offical docs: RecoveryMode).

Boot up the machine, and after the BIOS screen, hold down the left Shift key (note that for UEFI BIOS you might need press ESC instead). You will then be prompted by a menu that looks something like this:

n some systems that timing when to hit the left Shift key can be tricky, sometimes I miss it and need to try it again.

Hit the down arrow until you select the 2nd entry from the top (the one with the recovery mode in the description) and then hit Enter.


Using the arrow keys scroll down to root and then hit Enter.

You have to remount it with write permissions:

mount -o remount,rw /


You need to have physical access to the machine to do this. If someone has physical access to your PC, they could do far worse than change a password.
