You can fix this error by setting a shell for the desired user. You can do this via “chsh” command or by editing /etc/passwd file.

When using “chsh” command you should do something like this (you should run this as root or via sudo!):

[root@foo1 ~]# chsh -s /bin/bash geekpeek
[root@foo1 ~]# chsh -s /bin/bash geekpeeknet
 

After this /etc/passwd user line should look something like this:

geekpeek:x:500:500::/home/geekpeek:/bin/bash
geekpeeknet:x:501:501::/home/geekpeeknet:/sbin/bash
