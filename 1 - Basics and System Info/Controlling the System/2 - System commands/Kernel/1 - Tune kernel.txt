use sysctl 

sysctl -a | less


To enable IP forwarding, change the 0 to a 1 by entering the following:

sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Remember that that sysctl changes take place at runtime but are lost when the system is
rebooted. To make permanent changes to sysctl , you need to edit configuration file
/etc/sysctl.conf.

In that config file just uncomment the "net.ipv4.ip_forward" line
