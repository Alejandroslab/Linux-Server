Unlike the default behaviour which is to end after printing certain number of lines,
the -f option “which stands for follow” will keep the stream going.
It will start printing extra lines on to console added to the file after it is opened.

This command will keep the file open to display updated changes to console until the user breaks the command.

tail -f /path/to/file


service crond start ; tail -f /var/log/cron


The same tail -f command can be replicated using less command well. Once you open a file with less

less /path/to/filename

Once you open file, then press shift+f

Example:

Mar 21 08:25:01 sanne-taggle CRON[5553]: (root) CMD (command -v debian-sa1 > /dev/null && debian-sa1 1 1)Mar 21 08:27:24 sanne-taggle wpa_supplicant[807]: wlan0: WPA: Group rekeying completed with da:3c:69:04:b1:21 [GTK=CCMP]Mar 21 08:35:01 sanne-taggle CRON[5982]: (root) CMD (command -v debian-sa1 > /dev/null && debian-sa1 1 1)Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)
In order to come out from update mode in less, you have to press ctrl+c and then press q for quit.
