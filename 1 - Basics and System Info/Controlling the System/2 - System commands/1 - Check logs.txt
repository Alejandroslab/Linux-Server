In debian:

/etc/rsyslog.conf

here you will find all the system rules for logging 

messages have "priority" that can be '*', 'debug', 'emerg',...'crit'...

structure will be something like:

mail.* /var/log/mail
This example will log mail events of all ( * ) priorities to /var/log/mail.


kern.crit /var/log/kernel
This example will log kernel events of critical ( crit ) priority or higher to
/var/log/kernel.

*.emerg *
This last example will log all events of the emergency ( emerg ) priority to all loggedÂ­on
users.


You can configure the logrotate utility to choose the regularity of your log
rotation with the /etc/logrotate.conf text file
/etc/logrotate.conf

you will see there "weekly" or "daily" and then a number that corresponds to the number of weeks or days 


At the end of each rotation period, the log files are renamed and pushed toward the end
of the chain of logs as a new log file is created, replacing the current log file. For
instance, /var/log.auth will become /var/log.auth.1, then /var/log.auth.2, and so on.
