Just run the sudoers file with the command:

sudo visudo


Look for this line:

Defaults    env_reset

And add timestamp_timeout=X (with a comma) at the end of it, where X is the time you want to set in minutes.

So your line should look like this, as an example:

Defaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=5
