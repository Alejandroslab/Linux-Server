bashrc or bash_profile are hidden files in your home directory
that allow you to make some customizations
from indicating the folders to be added to the PATH
to change colors for the terminal etc..

you can apply your changes making it persistent with:

source .bashrc
or
source .bash_profile

Remember that if bashrc does not seem to work then
you source file must be .bash_profile or .profile!
