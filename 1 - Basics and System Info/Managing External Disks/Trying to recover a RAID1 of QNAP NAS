QNAP has introcuded a proprietary way to assemble and manage a RAID.

As a test I have plugged in an HD into a bay, create a new storage pool and a new volume
where I created a shared folder called 'Test' with inside another folder and a txt file.

Then I have unplugged it and tried to boot it first with Manjaro and then with an image of Ubuntu (live cd)
Anyways results are pretty similar.

lsblk 

linux raid member partitioon are present.

Then assemble the raid as usual with 'mdadm  --assemble ....' command

It could happen that after assembling the raid and tried to mount this error appears:

mount: unknown filesystem type 'drbd'.


It seems that they don't use
simple RAID1 based on mdadm in QNAP NAS. They use DRBD (Distributed
Replicated Block Device) atop of it

To mount this disk you'd need to add DRBD on your Debian host.
Installing drbd-utils (and configuring it properly) should be
sufficient.

The RAID array does not contain a filesystem but is used by DRBD (distributed replicated block device)

Like layers such as RAID or LVM, 
you have to "activate" the block device(s) with whatever admin command
is designed for the task (drbdadm, drbdsetup, drdbmeta ?). Then, if it
contains a filesystem, you can mount it.
