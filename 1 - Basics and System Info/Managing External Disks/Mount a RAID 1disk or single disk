Commands may slightly differ according to your OS (Ubuntu, manjaro)
It may be seen as tricky at first but then you will see that commands make sense if you have some experience

Anyways it is better to stick with a common OS like Ubuntu for this kind of task

First thing to do is to check your disks with:

lsblk

whenever you plug your external hd with RAID (or single disk) the system may mount it automatically.
This happens for Manjaro but will not happen for Ubuntu.

The process, if system will not automatically mount the partition is the following.


You have to use 'mdadm' package to accomplish this (run with sudo -i)

mdadm --assemble --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1

this will mount sdc1 partition on md0. md0 is virtual partition that you will need in order to access to your hd

Anyways it is not mandatory to use md0 you can use any number, md1, md2, md345, etc.
