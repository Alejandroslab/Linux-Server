Commands may slightly differ according to your OS (Ubuntu, manjaro)
It may be seen as tricky at first but then you will see that commands make sense if you have some experience

Anyways it is better to stick with a common OS like Ubuntu for this kind of task

First thing to do is to check your disks with:

lsblk

whenever you plug your external hd with RAID (or single disk) the system may mount it automatically.
This happens for Manjaro but will not happen for Ubuntu.



The process, if system will not automatically mount the partition is the following.

First with 'lsblk' check what is the partition you need as more than one may exist.

Then you have to use 'mdadm' package to accomplish this (run with sudo -i) )(in Ubuntu you have to install it first. You must also install 'lvm2'. Then load the device mapper kernel module with
modprobe dm-mod
In Manjaro everything comes preinstalled)

mdadm --assemble --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1

this will mount sdc1 partition on md0. md0 is virtual partition that you will need in order to access to your hd

Anyways it is not mandatory to use md0 you can use any number, md1, md2, md345, etc.




After this process finishes you can mount the virtual partition with:

mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test

where /mnt/test is a folder that you must create before the mount command (/mnt usually exists maybe used because directly has permissions)

Rememeber that you may need to specifiy the filesystem name:

mount -t <name of filesystem here> /dev/md0 /mnt/test


filesystem may be: ext3, ext4, etc..

This is the normal process to do this.
Unfortunately most of the time you will incurr in some hiccups that will not allow you to proceed further (at least this is what happened to me)

1. First thing:

the 'mdadm --assemble' command does not work and states 'partition busy' or something similar (mdadm: /dev/sdb1 is busy - skipping message)

This may occur when the partition is already mounted. Check it with 'lsblk' or also withc cat /proc/mdstat. If you see /dev/md0 or other mounted 
then the command is not needed

You can anyways whenever you want to 'stop' the link between the origiinal partition and the virtual partition (md0,etc)

mdadm --stop /dev/md0

2. Second possible issue:

mount: /dev/md0: can't read superblock

I have fixed this rebooting the system and plugging and unplugging the HD.
You may also want to stop the md0 with the '--stop' command

3. Third issue:
mount: /mnt: unknown filesystem type 'linux_raid_member'.

This is easy: you are mounting a partition that is part of RAID

You maybe forgot to assemble the RAID with the command 'mdadm --assemble...'



ANOTHER WAY TO DO THINGS (NOT TESTED. TO BE TESTED NEXT,,)

You may want to mount every array without any hassle. You can do that with:

sudo mdadm --assemble --scan

Now, to do for just one:

sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0

(note that in this command the --run option is missing and the partition is not indicated)

This works if the array is defined in the configuration file. (/etc/mdadm.conf)


If it is missing from config file, you must pass all the component devices (component that 'compose' the RAID array)

sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd

this will assemble all disks inside the md0 disk. 
Note that in this case we have 'sda','sdb','sdc', etc
this means that these are different phisycal disks. 
This is useful (maybe) for RAID with multiple disks

finally mount the md0 disk, that is the assembled disk with:

sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/mydisk
