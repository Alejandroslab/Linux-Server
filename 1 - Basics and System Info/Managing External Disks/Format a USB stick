first check the location of your usb stick with

df -h
or

lsblk

then unmount it (as any devices attached to the linux system are automatically mounted)

sudo umount /dev/sdc2

where '/dev/sdc2' is the location of the usb stick as seen with the previous commnads
WARNING is 'umount' without the 'n'

now format with any file system you desire:

sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc2

for vFat file system

sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdc2

for ntfs file system

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc2

for ext4 file system

you can use the options -f (fast) or -Q (quick) to performa a quick format (otherwise it will take
a long time as will perform zero filling (data will be overwritten with zeroes. Very secure way to format
and hard drive))

therefore e.g. for ntfs the command will be:

sudo mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdc2
