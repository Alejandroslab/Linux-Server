Unmount your disk

then check the filesystem with:

sudo fsck.ext4 -v /dev/xxx

If the superblock is damaged something similar will pop up:

fsck /dev/sda5
fsck 1.41.4 (27-Jan-2009)
e2fsck 1.41.4 (27-Jan-2009)
fsck.ext4: Group descriptors look bad... trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext4: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda5
 
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
e2fsck -b 8193 <device>


Let's check in which sector are the superblock backups with:

sudo mke2fs -n /dev/xxx

You will get something like:

Superblock backups stored on blocks:
32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208

To recover the superblock:

sudo e2fsck -b block_number /dev/xxx

Then reboot!

If it still damaged try again with another block!
