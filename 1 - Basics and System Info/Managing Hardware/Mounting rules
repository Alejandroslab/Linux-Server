Mounting corresponds to the process that will link phisically and then logically an hard drive to your os 

when you phisically connect and hard drive it may not be logically connected therefore you may not see it in your os.




You have to create previously the folder in which you want to mount anywthing

You can mount the same device multiple times in different locations

to check disks and partitions:

lsblk

remember that disk will be labelled as: 'sda', 'sd-b', 'sd-c', 'sdd', 'sde', 'sdf', and so on


Usuallyy in linux mount points are:

/mnt  and /media even if any directory can be used!
