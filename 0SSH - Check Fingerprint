IN WINDOWS

At the first starting of Putty, a security alert will appear indicating then
'key fingerprint' in md5 format. Keep note of this fingerprint.

Click 'No' the first time then login in the server (Putty will ask to save in the cache)

type:

ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub

now compare the two fingerprint. if they are the same you can safely save the Connection
to the Putty's cache)

IN MAC AND LINUX

In Mac and Linux (whichever distro) just open Terminal, check if openssh is installed typing

ssh

then just:

ssh username@IPserverOrHostname

it will then ask for your password and then you will connect to the server.


For the fingerprint check, in mac it will be printed the ECDSA key in SHA256

therfore just type in your remote machine:

ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub

ECDSA it's a public key available in the folder /etc/ssh

REMEMBER! that you can always check any public key (those with extension .pub)
that are available in the folder going to:

cd /etc/ssh

ls -l

you will then use the command (for SHA256)

ssh-keygen -l -f

or the command

ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f

for md5


next you can quickly check differences with 'diff' command

first copy and paste the output from the remote machine

nano remotemachine_finger.txt

then do the same for the fingerprint displayed in Mac:

nano mac_finger.txt


then:

diff remotemachine_finger.txt mac_finger.txt


if it outputs nothing, then you are done! no differences between fingerprints.

You can safely add to cache the connection.
