You can use scp

scp myfile.txt remoteuser@remoteserver:/home/myremoteuser/

this will login to the remote machine and then automatically logout. 

this is not like sftp. with sftp you need to log in and then logout manually

with the scp command you do not need to do that 
_______________________-
REMEMBER!

you must add the part ":/home/myremoteuser/"

generally you must see the line wirh transfer speed
if you do not see anything. anything happened in this case
