Firewalld works wiht different set of rules (protocols, services and ports)
A single set of rules is grouped in zones 

Every zone is different. There are some default that come preinstalled.
to see the available zones:


 sudo firewall-cmd --get-zones
 
 You can enable one or more zones. They are called 'active'. 
 To see the active zones:
 
  sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
 You will see the names of the zones along with the interfaces that are connected.
 
You can also see the main one that is called 'default':

sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

Usually the default zone is the one called 'public'.

You can change the default one with:

sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=home

with this you will change the zone to 'home'. 'Home' zone has enabled the SSH protocol: 

Remember also to reload firewalld:

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

check the default zone again with:

sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

Be careful to not be locked out. 'Home' zone has enabled by default the SSH protocol and therefore the connection will not drop but other zones may not have it enabled.


firewalld has several built in zones:

zone	example use
drop	drop incoming connections without reply - only outgoing packets are allowed
block	incoming connections are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited message for IPv4 and icmp6-adm-prohibited for IPv6
public	all incoming connections are allowed
external	for use on external networks with masquerading enabled
dmz	for computers on your demilitarized zone that are publicly-accessible with limited access to your internal network
work	for computers in work areas (nope, I don't get this one either)
home	for use in home areas (nope, I don't get this one either)
internal	for your internal network device access
trusted	all network connections are accepted
