From Ubuntu 17 to manage network interfaces 'netplan' is used

netplan uses a YAML configuration file that we can setup

first check the network interfaces with the command:

ip link

then you can check and open the config file :

/etc/netplan directory

Usually, the file is named either 01-netcfg.yaml, 50-cloud-init.yaml, or NN_interfaceName.yaml, but in your system it may be different.

Now remember that indentation is important here
You will get something similar to this:

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: yes


If I have for example the ethernet called 'ens4' and I want to assign it with dhcp then I will have to add it to this file in this order:


network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: yes
    ens4:
      dhcp4: yes

I suppose that dhcp4 stands for IPV4

Then I can also add another one (a static IP) with name 'ens5'

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: yes
    ens4:
      dhcp4: yes
    ens5:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.121.221/24
      gateway4: 192.168.121.1
      nameservers:
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]

Save and exit then run:Ã¹

sudo netplan apply

REMEMBER tha this changes are persistent. This means that they will persistent even after a reboot (contrarily to what happens with the ifconfig command)

To check that it worked you can check a network interface in this way:

ip addr show dev ens4
