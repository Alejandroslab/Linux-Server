In Debian and Ubuntu, it is found in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Find the line that says:

#PrintLastLog yes
And change it to:

PrintLastLog no
(Or add it if not existing.)

Finally restart your ssh daemon (mandatory):

sudo service ssh restart

You can restart it even when you are logged in

In RHEL you must use:

sudo systemctl restart sshd

you cannot use 'service'
