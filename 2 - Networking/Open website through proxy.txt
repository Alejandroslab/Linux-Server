proxychains firefox www.google.com

will open firefox via a proxy that you can define in the file /etc/proxychains under [ProxyLists]

if you add more than one proxy your packet will travel through different proxies.

remember to uncomment the 'dynamic_chain' line otherwise if a proxy is down your packet will stop surfing
