If you have troubles with networking inside a vm in VMware ESXi 
Remember that you are inside an Hypervisor!

Check the adapters assigned in VMware for that particular machines

(for example if you want 10gbps connection you cannot select the virutal E1000 adapter but you must select the VMXNET3 adapter...)
