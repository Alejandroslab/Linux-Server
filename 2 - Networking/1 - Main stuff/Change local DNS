just change the file

sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

you will see something like:

nameserver 192.168.1.1

..

Change there with the DNS IP you like

you can use:

192.168.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8

if you specify nameserver the IP will be recognized as external. Without 'nameserver' your IP will be local

to quickly append

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf



Additional nameserver directives after the first are only used when the first or last used server is unavailable
