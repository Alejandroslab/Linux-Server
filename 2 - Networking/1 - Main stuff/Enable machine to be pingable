sometimes you may want an host to be ping-able that means that you can ping it or recall withouth knowing the ip

some OS'es have firewalld zones enable that does not allow that.

So the easiset solution is to turn uff (disable) firewalld.

The more elegant solution is to change the firewalld setting in order to be discoverable in the local network.




Usually the default zone is the one called 'public'.

You can change the default one with 'home' zone that allows to be discoverable (and also leave the SSH protocol enabled)

sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=home

with this you will change the zone to 'home'. 

Finally remember also to reload firewalld:

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

check the default zone again with:

sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

Be careful to not be locked out. 'Home' zone has enabled by default the SSH protocol and therefore the connection will not drop but other zones may not have it enabled.
