To request an IP address from DHCP, simply call the DHCP server with the command
dhclient followed by the interface you want the address assigned to. Different Linux
distributions use different DHCP clients, but Kali is built on Debian, which uses
dhclient. Therefore, you can assign a new address like this:

dhclient eth0


The dhclient command sends a DHCPDISCOVER request from the network interface specified
(here, eth0 ). It then receives an offer ( DHCPOFFER ) from the DHCP server (192.168.181.131
in this case) and confirms the IP assignment to the DHCP server with a dhcp request.
Now when you enter ifconfig , you should see that the DHCP server has assigned a new
IP address, a new broadcast address, and new netmask to your network interface eth0 .
