You must use:

ip addr

(as this is the new standard )

But you can also check the IP with other commands:


hostname -I

hostname without 'I' will provide just the hostname of the machine

remember that the 'I' is capital letter.

if you put 'i' you will get another Ip

ifconfig
This latter requires 'net tools' package installed. Otherwise:
sudo apt install net-tools
