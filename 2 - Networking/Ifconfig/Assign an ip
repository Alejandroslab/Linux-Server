to assign an IP to a machine
first you need to check that the adapter is up

to do that just run

ifconfig

then run:


sudo ifconfig 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255

(the broadcast address usually ends with '255' when the netmask is the common 255.255.255.0
if the netmask is different then the  broadcast address will be different as well )

you must indicate the netmask and the broadcast address alongside the ip


with this command you will assign statically the ip 192.168.1.2 to the machine


CAREFUL this will not mean that your machine will automatically connect to the same hosts
You mmay need to make it persistent
