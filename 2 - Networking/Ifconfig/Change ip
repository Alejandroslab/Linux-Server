To change your IP address, enter ifconfig followed by the interface you want to reassign
and the new IP address you want assigned to that interface.

For example, to assign the
IP address 192.168.181.115 to interface eth0 , you would enter the following:


ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115


with the same logic you can also change your netmask and your broadcast address

ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255
