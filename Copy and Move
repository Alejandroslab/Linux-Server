Command

cp file folder

example

cp test.txt \home\user1\destionationfolder



BUT!
when you have to copy a folder you have to add -r option (recursive. that
means that will copy all the files of the folder)

cp -r myfolder \home\user1


if you need 2 files or folder just:

cp file1 file2 \home\user1\destionationfolder

for folders:

cp -r folder1 folder 2 \home\user1
