if you are looking in a very big folder you may use:

find folder1

or

find fol*

with the * symbol that allow to search all the file and folders
which names starts with 'fol'

if you need to find some files with extension like .mobi

find myfolder -name "*.mobi"

where myfolder is the folder or the path that points to
the folder that you are working with to look for all
the .mobi files

REMEMBER! find is always recursive.
it will search in any subdirectory
Hence there is no need to add an '-r' option.

if you need to just find inside a particular folder without looking inside the subdirectories use
the MaxDepth option:

find -maxdepth 1 -name 'Paul*'

this command will look with all the files and folders whose name starts with 'Paul..'
ONLY in the working directory

with 1 that limits searching only in 1 level

and if you need to count the result you can pipe it
in this way:

find General-Library/ -name "*.mobi" | wc -l

where wc -l will count the lines of the finding resutls
