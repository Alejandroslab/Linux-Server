if you are looking in a very big folder you may use:

find folder1

or

find fol*

with the * symbol that allow to search all the file and folders
which names starts with 'fol'

if you need to find some files with extension like .mobi

find myfolder -name "*.mobi"

where myfolder is the folder or the path that points to
the folder that you are working with to look for all
the .mobi files

REMEMBER! find is always recursive.
it will search in any subdirectory
Hence there is no need to add an '-r' option.


and if you need to count the result you can pipe it
in this way:

find General-Library/ -name "*.mobi" | wc -l

where wc -l will count the lines of the finding resutls
