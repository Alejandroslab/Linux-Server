just use the 'cat' command in this way:

cat /home/user/oldfile.txt > myfile.txt

if 'myfile.txt' does not exist in your current working
folder, it will be created. if it exist this will be overwritten

cat means concatenate

cat test1.txt test2.txt

will concatenate and display the content of the 2 files
