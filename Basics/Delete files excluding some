you can use rsync as in 'Copy all files and folders'

it is a workaround
rsync will copy the files to
another folder
like 'tmp'

then will remove from source
with the option

--remove-source-files


_________________________________________________________________
other way to remove multiple files and or directory
with similar names is to use
find
in this way:

let's say we have multiple folder whose name starts with 'Anne..'

if I want to delete all folder that starts with 'Anne..' and
onlyy delete them in the current working directory (no recursively)
run this:

 find -maxdepth 1 -name 'Anne*' -exec rm -r {} \;

-MaxDepth 1 will allow to remove the default recursive option for find command

-name indicates that the next word is the name of the file or folder

-exec rm -r .... is to delete the folders

in this case the option '-r' is added because we need to delete folders that are not empty
otherwise, in the case you need to delete just files you can remove the '-r ' option

you can also safely delete all folder with the initial

find -maxdepth 1 -name 'K*' -exec rm -r {} \;

will delete all folders starting with capital 'K'
This is safe to use it even in 'home' folder because will not remove any hidden files


you can then build a script to run this for all the letters of the alphabet
