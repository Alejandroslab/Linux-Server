To remove a directory

rmdir



BUT! rmdir will work only if the folder is empty!

If it is not empty you can use

rm -r myfolder

(the same logic for copying folder (that is adding -r that means recursively))


REMEMBER! rm is irreversible
be careful on what you delete!

_______________

to remove ALL files inside a directory:

rm *

if you want to remove all subdirectories + files inside a folder just use the recursive option

rm -r *
