Command

cp file folder

example

cp test.txt \home\user1\destionationfolder



BUT!
when you have to copy a folder you have to add -r option (recursive. that
means that will copy all the files of the folder)

cp -r myfolder \home\user1




if you need 2 files or folder just:

cp file1 file2 \home\user1\destionationfolder

for folders:

cp -r folder1 folder 2 \home\user1


to move:


mv file folder

to move more than 1 item:


cp file file2 destionation_folder

if you need to copy or move a large folder
you may want to see your progress (otherwise you will get
only a stuck cursor)

in order to see progresses just use the verbose option
that is '-v'

cp -v -r folder1 \home\user1

or

mv -v -r folder1 \home\user1
