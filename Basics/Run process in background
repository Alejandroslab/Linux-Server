you can use the symbol &

If a command is terminated by the control operator &,
the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.
The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.

ls &
means that the list should be run in the background

the shell does not wait the command to finish

is useful when you work in ssh with multiple processes
