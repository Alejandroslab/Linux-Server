Building from source means download the source code (extension
is for example usually .c if the code is written in C language) of
the software that you are trying to install and
build the binary from scratch (compiling it)

(source = codice sorgente ovvero codice)
(An example of this is Python in Debian.)

Therefore you the source code that you have downloaded
Next you proceed to compile it. This means that the computer
will perform all the necessary to make the
source code understandable for the system..

This work is done by the compiler that will at the end create
a binary file that is a file ready to be used.
(In Windows a binary file is .exe or .dll, but could also be
an .msi file)

A source code (the .c file) will instead be inserted in a zip file,
more specifically in a .7z, or .tar.bz2 files.

Therefore when you download some .tar files
you are basically downloading the code of the program
and you will make it compile (remember the command 'make'?)

The notorious setup installers in Windows are basically
like zip files that unzip themselves and copy
the binaries to the right folders in your system

Binaries therefore are the programs built from sources using compilers

In Linux binaries should be copied to the PATH folder
to make available the invoke from every path of the system
but can also be installed everywhere and run everywhere
if you move to their folder

Therfore the notorious installation in Windows is
basically an extracting process of the binaries (the .exe file/s)
While in Windows something else could also be annotated
in the famous Registry..

In Linux installation means only extracting the binaries
