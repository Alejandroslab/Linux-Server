use rysnc:

rsync -av --progress sourcefolder destinationfolder

you can exclude folders and files adding them (one by one (but you can also use a file))
with the option

--exclude folder

therefore:

rsync -av --progress sourcefolder destinationfolder --exclude folder_to_be_excluded

you can exclude multiple folder adding other --exclude options

rsync -av --progress sourcefolder destinationfolder --exclude folder_to_be_excluded --exclude folder2_to_exclude .....

CAREFUL! by default rsyn will copy ALSO the HIDDEN files
to exclude hidden files and folders just add

--exclude=".*"

if you only want to exclude hidden directories:

--exclude=".*/"


therefore: to copy all the content from source to destination excluding a folder and hidden files:

rsync -av --progress sourcefolder destinationfolder --exclude folder_to_be_excluded --exclude=".*"



you can also create a text (if you have multiple files and directories to exclude)
and use:

--exclude-from='myfile.txt'

___________________
CAREFUL when you set your source and destination folder be careful
if you want to copy ONLY THE CONTENT of a source folder like

/home/myuser

the content of the 'myuser' home,
you need to add the '\' at the end!

therefore the command will be like:

rsync -av --progress \home\myuser\ destinationfolder ....

if you omit the '\' symbol you will copy THE FOLDER WITH INSIDE ITS content

rsync -av --progress \home\myuser destinationfolder ....

therefore be careful (this is important with really large transfers)
