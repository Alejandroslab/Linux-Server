Install Samba

sudo apt-get install samba

Configure new user:

sudo smbpasswd -a utentesamba

Where 'utentesamba' is a name that you will provide as user. To keep it simple you could choose 
a username equal to the login user in linux.

Now create a shared folder

mkdir nomecartelladacondividere

Open the configuration file for Samba:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Just type these commands at the end of the document:

[nomecartelladacondividere]
path = /home/utentelinux/nomecartelladacondividere
available = yes
valid users = utentesamba
Read only = no 
Browsable = yes 
public = yes
writable = yes

Between the squared brackets you have to type the name of the shared folder previously created.

Save and close (with classic nano commands)


Now restart Samba

sudo service smbd restart

DONE!

Now go to Windows and create a new shortcut:

\\IP-ADDRESS\nomecartelladacondividere

You can swap ip address with hostname if you desire (without the suffix '.local'). Click next then finish.

Now when you will try to open it will request username and password (the ones created in the configuration file).
