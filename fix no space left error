No space left on device 
when you do not have even a small amount of space you will get errors and some commands will not work (like sudo snap list)


If is your workstation and you don't need the logs you can delete them. They are located in:

/var/log
You can check the space in use with:

sudo du -h /var/log/
In my case I'm using 4.5 GB with 4.1GB in /var/log/journal. So if you want to limit the size of your log journal to 100MB you can do:

sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
