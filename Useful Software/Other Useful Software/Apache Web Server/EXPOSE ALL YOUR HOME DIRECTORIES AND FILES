I wanted to expose via apache all my home directories and files

of course this will be local only 


We know that apache will look for the 'index.html' inside your folder /var/www/html or /var/www/your_domain

When you delete it, Apache will show by default the content folder that you have set up listing all directories and files.
Delete the index.html file inside your_domain or html folder

Nowe just have to change the content folder!


to do go to

sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.conf

or 

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

if you have not set up a virtual host

then

change the folder in:

DocumentRoot /var/www/html

to

DocumentRoot /home/myuser/


save and exit 



now we should change the same content folder in:

sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

find this block:

<Directory /var/www/html/>
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride None
   Require all granted
</Directory>


and change it:

<Directory /home/myuser/>
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride None
   Require all granted
</Directory>

save and exit

now reload apache

sudo systemctl reload apache2

DONE!
now if you connect via any browser (even via phone) to http://your_domain' or 'http://your_hostname' you will get 
the browsable list of all directories and files of your system!
