You need to set passwordless ssh with public private keys pairs


to do that on your "master" machine run:

ssh-keygen


then just press enter (you may want to set a passphrase)
This will create a public key

Then transfer the public key to your remote hosts with the command:

ssh-copy-id

therefore:

ssh-copy-id myuser@myhost
ssh-copy-id myuser@myhost2
ssh-copy-id myuser@myhost3
...

do this for any hosts you may want to use
finally you can check that you can enter withou password to your hosts via ssh

ssh myuser@myhost

done

WINDOWS: In windows ssh-copy-id will not work
the easiest workaround is to use 'Git Bash'
