SFTP, which stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol, or Secure File Transfer Protocol,

SFTP uses the SSH protocol to authenticate

if you have ssh you can connect with sftp

sftp username@ipaddress_or_hostname


if you work with another port than 22:

sftp -oPort=your_port sammy@your_server_ip_or_remote_hostname

where your_port is your port (different than 22)

if you will successfully connect you will see:

sftp>

you can use then the commands


bye                                Quit sftp
cd path                            Change remote directory to 'path'
chgrp grp path                     Change group of file 'path' to 'grp'
chmod mode path                    Change permissions of file 'path' to 'mode'
chown own path                     Change owner of file 'path' to 'own'
df [-hi] [path]                    Display statistics for current directory or
                                   filesystem containing 'path'
exit                               Quit sftp
get [-Ppr] remote [local]          Download file
help                               Display this help text
lcd path                           Change local directory to 'path'
. . .

remember! Now if you use 'pwd' (or 'ls') you will get the remote path (or list of files/folder)
 (the path/files and folders of the server and not the local ones)

if you want to use pwd in local machine (client) you will need to put the letter 'l' (of 'local')
before any commands
therefore:

pwd will become 'lpwd', ls will become 'lls'

TRANSFER FILES:

DOWNLOAD FILES:
if you want to download a file just use the 'get' command:

get myfile

with recursive option you can copy a folder and all its content

get -r myfolder

REMEMBER: if you use get then the file or folder will be download in your
local folder
If you have logged in with sftp while in a different folder rather than home
like

/home/myuser/anotherfolder

You will donwload your file in that location!








UPLOAD FILES:
if you want to upload some files to your server you can use

put mylocalfile

in windows you can also drag your files or folders inside powershell and it will paste the path of your files or folder

the usual path in which sftp will upload your files will be '/home/USERNAME/''
in Powershell autocomplete will not work you have to manually navigate with 'cd'


if you need to upload a folder use the recursive option:

put -r mylocalfolder

you can also upload from a newtork folder. it is not necessary to be a local folder (at least this is how it works on Windows)

In Windows you should create a network drive in order to assign a letter a work with the paths easily




CAREFUL when you use

put -r mylocalfolder

IT COULD HAPPEN THAT ONLY THE CONTENT WILL BE COPIED IF YOU ARE NOT careful

therefore be careful on where you want to store your data


if you type:

put -r //network/myfolder

it will be copied the folder 'myfolder' with inside all its Content

(in Powershell you will need to double quote the path " //network/myfolder")


if you type:

put -r //network/myfolder/

then only the content will be copied


__-

with df -h you can check your space (no local variation (the 'l')for this command)
you can use the symbol '!' to use your local
