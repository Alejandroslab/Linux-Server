to check the current hostname:

hostnamectl

or:

hostname -I
as in any other linux distro


to set a new hostname:

hostnamectl set-hostname mynewhostname

where 'mynewhostname' is the new hostname you want to set

after that you will need to change it in the /etc/hosts

to do that:

vi /etc/hosts

if you do not have set your current user with sudo privileges you will need to
switch user to 'root' otherwise you will not be able to save:

su root

type in the password and then again:

vi /etc/hosts

Inside this file you will see:

127.0.0.1  localhost localhost.localdomain localhost 4 localhost4.localdomain4 old.hostname
::1     ................

the first line is the IPV4 set line and the second line is the IPV6

'old.hostname' is the previous hostname that you need to change
BUT! if you have not set it up correctly during the installation then you will not find any
hostname 'old.hostname'
In this case just type in your desired hostname at the end of the line (the first line is IPV4)


then reboot the machine:

reboot

done!
