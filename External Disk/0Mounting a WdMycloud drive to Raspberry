let's create a folder in which we will create the link

mkdir wdmycloud


then mount the network path inside this folder with this command



sudo mount -t cifs //MyNAS/Media/Videos/'Movies and others' /home/myuser/wdmycloud -o credentials=/home/myuser/mycredentials

the syntax:

sudo mount -t (mountype) (source path) (destination path) -o (options) credentials=(credentials path)

in this case the folder will be accessed with a credentials file called 'mycredentials' that will be available in the home folders

inside mycredentials file you just have to put:

username=value
password=value
domain=value

without spaces between username, password and domain and their correpsondent Value

anyways the command will work even without 'domain=value'

therefore just with:

username=value
password=value


____________________
In the case of just a guest account:

sudo mount -t (mountype) (source path) (destination path) -o guest
____________________

to keep mounted the folder you should put them in fstab

sudo nano /etc/fstab

//MyNAS/Media/Videos/'Movies and others' /home/myuser/wdmycloud cifs guest     0       0

this will automatically mount the folder when you boot the system (if you leave your system always on then this problem does not exist)
