THE BACKUP PROCESS WILL TAKE A WHILE
Be sure to have sufficient space:

Now just go to root folder:

cd /

then type:

sudo tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /

where 'backup.tgz' is the name of the backup file
the 'exclude' options exclude unnecessary folders

rememer that tar is always uncompressed!

to look inside your tar:


tar -tf backup.tgz

or you can also pipe it to set a tree view:

tar -tf filename.tar.gz | tree
