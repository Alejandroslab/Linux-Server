dd is a bit-by-bit copy utility. this will create a physical copy of the hard drive with deleted files.
even deleted files are copied. 
deleted files will not be copied with most logical
copying utilities, such as cp .

dd if=inputfile of=outputfile

dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1

will copy sda1 to sdb1 


usually you will also set block size and the no error option

dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4096 conv:noerror

noerror will allow you to continue even with errors
bs=4096 will change the block size and speed up the process. Usualyy dd is slow.
