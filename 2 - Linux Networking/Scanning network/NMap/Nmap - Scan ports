To scan open ports (of every server)
Just insall nmap

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap

nmap --Version

you can scan ips or directly webpages

nmap 192.168.0.1

nmap www.website.org

Detect Firewall settings:
nmap -sA 192.168.0.1

To scan your network:

nmap -sP 192.168.0.1/24

it will scan all the Network

nmap --packet-trace 192.168.0.1 will show all the packets sent from nmap


if 'hosts seems down' message just do:

nmap -Pn IP

with option -Pn that in a sense "forces" to scan even if the receiver does not
manage ping.

nmap can also "decoy" that measn that sends a lot of packets and most of all will
confuse receiver. Only one packet will scan the others are just noise...
