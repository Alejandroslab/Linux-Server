use proxychains to scan a site with nmap anonymously, you would enter the following:


proxychains nmap -sT - Pn < IP address >

This would send the nmap –sS stealth scan command to the given IP address through a
proxy. The tool then builds the chain of proxies itself, so you don’t have to worry about
it.

you will find config file here:

/etc/proxychains.conf

under [ProxyLists]

You can find free proxies by
googling “free proxies” or using the site http://www.hidemy.name (just for educationsl purposes)
