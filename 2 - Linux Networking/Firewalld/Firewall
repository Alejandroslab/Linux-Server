UFW is also known as Uncomplicated firewall

  If the firewall is active some apps will not work properly as for example OpenSSH:

  therefore

  sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

  (if not installed: sudo apt-get install ufw)


  then

  sudo ufw enable

  type yes and proceed

  Then you can check the status

  sudo ufw status



  You can rule eveything even ports

  sudo ufw allow 3306
  sudo uf allow mysql
