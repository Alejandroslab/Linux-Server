Step 1: Install the CIFS Utils pkg

sudo apt-get install cifs-utils

Step 2: Create a mount point

sudo mkdir /mnt/local_share

Step 3: Mount the volume

sudo mount -t cifs -o user=<myuser> //<ip_address>/<export_share> /mnt/<local_share>

if your smb share has spaces in its path just use the " " like

"//my_ip/my shared folder"


if your user has password you will be asked for the password 


 Mounting at boot

to automatically mount at boot you need to add a line to your fstab file



add to /etc/fstab file:

    //<ip_address>/<export_share>  /mnt/<local_share> cifs user=<user on VPSA>,pass=<passwd on VPSA> 0 0
