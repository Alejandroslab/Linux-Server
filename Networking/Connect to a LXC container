You can create a container on a NAS server and run there your
linux distro (Debian, Ubuntu etc)

Now follow this if you want to add ssh connection:

in the container just follow the ssh instructions as usual

then in the container settings youhave to set a port forwarding to your container

it will basically linka a port of the NAS to the port 22 in the container

leave the network mode as NAT
then in portforwarding set:

Host: (the port in the NAS. it could be any port): 1099
Container: (the port in the container for the ssh that usually is 22): 22
Protocol: leave TCP

now it's done!

you will be able to connect with the following line from a remote machine:

ssh user@NASserver -p 1099

where NASserver is the hostname or IP of your server
you will indicate which port to look into with the syntax

-p 1099

therefore ssh will look in the port 1099 that is linked to port 22 of the Container
then you are done!
