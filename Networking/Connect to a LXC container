You can create a container on a NAS server and run there your
linux distro (Debian, Ubuntu etc)

REMEMBER! Difference between docker and LXC: while 'docker'
is just an image and it does not allow installation of 3rd party stuff,
about the second one (LXC) it is known that in LXC there is
the possibility to install app.


Now follow this if you want to add ssh connection:

in the container just follow the ssh instructions as usual

then in the container settings you have to set a port forwarding to your container

it will basically link a a port of the NAS to the port 22 in the container

leave the network mode as NAT
then in portforwarding set:

Host: (the port in the NAS. it could be any port): 1099
Container: (the port in the container for the ssh that usually is 22): 22
Protocol: leave TCP

now it's done!

you will be able to connect with the following line from a remote machine:

ssh user@NASserver -p 1099

where NASserver is the hostname or IP of your server
you will indicate which port to look into with the syntax

-p 1099

therefore ssh will look in the port 1099 that is linked to port 22 of the Container
then you are done!
