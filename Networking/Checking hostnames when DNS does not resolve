If you have trouble displaying the hostnames (even with nmap) a possible solution is to try with NETBIOS

just invoke one of the scripts that come installed with nmap that is 'nbstat.nse'

sudo nmap -sU --script nbstat.nse -p137 <host>

in <host> you can also type in a range like
192.168.1.0/24
or 

192.168.1.1/24

This will list all NETBIOS names that usually are available for any device (especially windows device) and that usually coincide with the hostname 
(unless something has not changed)
