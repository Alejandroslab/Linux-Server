to try to restart the network connection:

sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000

the mtu Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU), the largest physical packet size, measured in bytes, that a network can transmit.
Any messages larger than the MTU are divided into smaller packets before being sent.
By optimizing the MTU setting you can gain substantial network performance increases

sudo dhclient

open
/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf

inside the code:

...
#prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
	domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,
	netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu;
#require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;
#timeout 60;
....
delete iinterface-mtu (delete also the previous comma)

save exit and reboot


To change it permanently on Debian,
put it in the /etc/network/interfaces file
where almost all network parameters are found.
To do this, just add a line mtu to the definition of your interface and save the file.
