In Windows

download  VcXsrv or Xming (X11 for Windows) from sourceforge

I have chosen VcXsrv
Install and open it.

Keep 'Multiple Windows'
Click on 'Next'
Then tick 'Disable access control' and UNtick 'Native opengl'

Click on 'Finish'

Now it will begin to listen from server..

Open Putty and be sure that X11 Forwarding is enabled.

you will find it in

setting- > SSH->Auth->X11


Go to your server

generally x11 is enabled by default in ubuntu (or should also in debian)
anyways, you can check it here:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config


now you have to install python tk

sudo apt-get install python3-tk


Now you have to set the IP where point the images

export DISPLAY=IP_ADDRESS:0.0

e.g.

export DISPLAY=192.168.1.18:0.0

you could put this in the 'bashrc' file in order to automatically open it at startup
in this case the client should have static IP (it should work even with hostnames)



to quickly test this you can download the x11 apps:

sudo apt-get install x11-apps

let's start the calculator:

xcalc

if it opens on the screen of the client pc, it works!

this obviously works also with python

therefore you can plot everything in your client pc while make the computation in the server
