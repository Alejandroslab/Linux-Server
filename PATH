The PATH is the list of paths that the system will inspect to run applications.

You can add whichever folder you wish to the path.


sudo nano ~/.bash_profile

insert:

export PATH="$PATH:/home/user1/FolderforPath"

alwyas remember that the syntax $PATH is mandatory. If you delete it any command will work.


now refresh

source ~/.bash_profile



In the worst case scenario in which you mess up with the PATH, just type:

export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"

it will add the correct folder to the path and all the system commands will work.
It will be just for 1 session.
You have to restore the PATH at the previous state before closing the session.
