To show the type of shell used:

echo$0




A list of other useful commands:

To show the current path

pwd
pwd means print working directory

The main folder is
\home

Inside home there are the users like:

user1, user2

When user1 access then:

his working folder will be:

\home\user1

Inside the working folder you will be able to create folders, files etc.



to create a directory

mkdir newfolder

or

mkdir 'new folder'
if the folder has a space in the name


To remove a directory

rmdir



BUT! rmdir will work only if the folder is empty!

If it is not empty you can use

rm -r myfolder

(the same logic for copying folder (that is adding -r that means recursively))



to list all the files in a directory

ls

ls means list

to a more clean view:

ls -ls

or

ls -l

to save the list of files in a text:

ls > listfile.txt

to list all files (included hidden ones):

ls -a


to move between directories:

cd

cd means change directory

cd /tmp
to move to temporary

cd..
to go up to the parent directory


to move directly to the home directory (no matter the folder in which you are):

cd ~





to create a file

touch test.txt

to edit a file

nano test.txt

to save the file ctrl+x type 'y' and press enter
to search ctrl+w and type the word that you are looking for
ctrl+6 to highlight the text
alt+6 to copy the text

the alternative to nano is vim
to exit from vim:

:q!
to save and exit:

:wq


to rename a file

mv test.txt renamedtest.txt

in this case the test.txt file will be renamed as 'renamedtest.txt'

to move a file

mv renamedtest.txt \home\user1\newfolder

you can move files indicating the destination path




to delete a file

rm test.txt

you can check the removal with
ls






Finally for user01, a random test.txt:


/home/user01/test.txt

can also be denoted by

 ~/test.txt.
